Here we present a detailed hardware resource and protocol for building an upright, highly modular and adaptable two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscope that can be used for in

The dedicated design enabled imaging depths close to 1 mm into mouse brain tissue and a signal-to-noise ratio that exceeded all commercial two-photon systems tested. In addition to a detailed parts list, instructions for assembly, testing and troubleshooting, our plan includes complete three dimensional computer models that greatly reduce the knowledge base required for the non-expert user. This open-source resource lowers barriers in order to equip more laboratories with high-performance two-photon imaging and to help progress our understanding of the cellular and physiological function of living systems.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate hydroxyapatite paste ({BoneSource}; Leibinger Corp., Dallas, {TX}) as an alloplastic implant for supraorbital and malar augmentation. Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats had cylindrical onlay implants made of the hydroxyapatite cement placed above their left orbits on the supraorbital rim. Size-matched Medpor implants were placed similarly on the right side. To test the utility of this new material in the midface, hydroxyapatite paste and Medpor implants were also placed in the right malar regions of a different set of rats. The implants were left in situ for 6 months and examined for evidence of bone ingrowth, infection, migration, resorption, and detrimental effects on the surrounding tissue. All hydroxyapatite cement implants provided excellent soft tissue projection and demonstrated steadfast adherence to the adjacent bone. The surface of the hydroxyapatite implant in contact with the native bone demonstrated evidence of native bony ingrowth into approximately 12\% of the implant. There was no evidence of implant migration or gross infection. There was no bony resorption below the hydroxyapatite paste, but four of the Medpor implants showed evidence of this in the underlying bone. Only one negative aspect to the use of hydroxyapatite cement paste as an onlay implant was identified. Two of the supraorbital and one of the malar hydroxyapatite implants had approximately 20 to 25\% volume loss during the experimental period (P = 0.05). Overall, the vast majority of the implants retained their original form. We concluded that hydroxyapatite paste may possibly be used to effectively augment bone in the supraorbital and malar regions. Its biocompatibility, excellent bony adherence, and tendency to be replaced by natural bone may make it suitable for the aesthetic patient. The possible resorptive aspects of the material need to be evaluated further.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) leaks are a common concern in skull base surgery. Appropriate dural healing is crucial to prevent {CSF} leaks but the entire process has been barely understood so far. Here, we review the impact of growth factors and chemotherapeutic agents on an explant culture of human dural fibroblasts and a 3D subculture grown in a collagen mesh scaffold.
{METHODS}: Human dural specimens were harvested during surgical procedures where they would not be further used therapeutically or diagnostically. Explant cultures were grown in Petri dishes, and subcultures were grown in collagen mesh scaffolds. Insulin, fibroblast growth factor type 2 ({FGF}-2), and human serum were analyzed for their effect as growth factors, whereas mitomycin C, vincristine, and colchicine were analyzed for their role as inhibitors. Cell count was used as a parameter to assess the effects of these factors. In addition, the effects of human serum were assessed using collagen mesh scaffolds.
{RESULTS}: Insulin, {FGF}-2, and human serum increased culture cell count; human serum also achieved an increased number of viable fibroblasts embedded in a collagen mesh. Mitomycin C, which is a mitosis inhibitor, showed no significant effect on cell count, whereas colchicine and vincristine, which inhibit both mitosis and migration, resulted in cell growth suppression.
{DISCUSSION}: In our model, dural defect closure is achieved through cell migration rather than through cell growth. Adding growth factors to the dural suture line or into a collagen mesh might prove useful to stimulate dural closure.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiological recording in alert monkeys requires the creation of a permanent aperture in the skull for repeated insertion of microelectrodes. Most laboratories use polymethyl methacrylate to attach a recording chamber over the skull opening. Here, we describe a titanium chamber that fastens to the skull with screws, using no polymethyl methacrylate. The gap between the base of the chamber and the skull is filled with hydroxyapatite, forming a watertight gasket. As the chamber base osseointegates with the skull, the hydroxyapatite is replaced with bone. Rather than having a finite lifetime, the recording chamber becomes more firmly anchored the longer it is in place. It has a small footprint, low profile, and needs little maintenance to control infection. Toilette consists of occasional application of betadine to clean the scalp margin, followed by application of neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ointment. Antibiotic is also placed inside the chamber to suppress bacterial proliferation. Thickening of the dura within the chamber can be prevented by regular application of mitocycin C and/or bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. By conducting an e-mail survey, this protocol for chamber maintenance was compared with procedures used in 37 other vision research laboratories. Refinement of appliances and techniques used for recordings in awake monkeys promises to increase the pace of scientific discovery and to benefit animal welfare.},

	abstract = {An important issue for neurophysiological studies of the visual system is the definition of the region of the visual field that can modify a neuron's activity (i.e., the neuron's receptive field – {RF}). Usually a trade-off exists between precision and the time required to map a {RF}. Manual methods (qualitative) are fast but impose a variable degree of imprecision, while quantitative methods are more precise but usually require more time. We describe a rapid quantitative method for mapping visual {RFs} that is derived from computerized tomography and named back-projection. This method finds the intersection of responsive regions of the visual field based on spike density functions that are generated over time in response to long bars moving in different directions. An algorithm corrects the response profiles for latencies and allows for the conversion of the time domain into a 2D-space domain. The final product is an {RF} map that shows the distribution of the neuronal activity in visual–spatial coordinates. In addition to mapping the {RF}, this method also provides functional properties, such as latency, orientation and direction preference indexes. This method exhibits the following beneficial properties: (a) speed; (b) ease of implementation; (c) precise {RF} localization; (d) sensitivity (this method can map {RFs} based on few responses); (e) reliability (this method provides consistent information about {RF} shapes and sizes, which will allow for comparative studies); (f) comprehensiveness (this method can scan for {RFs} over an extensive area of the visual field); (g) informativeness (it provides functional quantitative data about the {RF}); and (h) usefulness (this method can map {RFs} in regions without direct retinal inputs, such as the cortical representations of the optic disc and of retinal lesions, which should allow for studies of functional connectivity, reorganization and neural plasticity). Furthermore, our method allows for precise mapping of {RFs} in a 30° by 30° area of the visual field for an array of microelectrodes of any size in less than 6 min.},

The microfluidic device, which is a novel free-standing multifunctional pipette, allows diverse superfusion experiments, such as testing the effects of different concentrations of drugs or drug candidates on neurons in different cell layers with high positional accuracy, affecting only a small number of cells. We demonstrate herein the use of the method with electrophysiological recordings of pyramidal cells in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex brain slices from rats, determine the dependence of electric responses on the distance of the superfusion device from the recording site, document a multifold gain in solution exchange time as compared to whole slice perfusion, and show that the device is able to store and deliver up to four solutions in a series. Localized solution delivery by means of open-volume microfluidic technology also reduces reagent consumption and tissue culture expenses significantly, while allowing more data to be collected from a single tissue slice, thus reducing the number of laboratory animals to be sacrificed for a study.},

	abstract = {Background
Statistical inference of signals is key to understand fundamental processes in the neurosciences. It is essential to distinguish true from random effects. To this end, statistical concepts of confidence intervals, significance levels and hypothesis tests are employed. Bootstrap-based approaches complement the analytical approaches, replacing the latter whenever these are not possible.
New method
Block-bootstrap was introduced as an adaption of the ordinary bootstrap for serially correlated data. For block-bootstrap, the signals are cut into independent blocks, yielding independent samples. The key parameter for block-bootstrapping is the block length. In the presence of noise, naïve approaches to block-bootstrapping fail. Here, we present an approach based on block-bootstrapping which can cope even with high noise levels. This method naturally leads to an algorithm of block-bootstrapping that is immediately applicable to observed signals.
Results
While naïve block-bootstrapping easily results in a misestimation of the block length, and therefore in an over-estimation of the confidence bounds by 50\%, our new approach provides an optimal determination of these, still keeping the coverage correct.
Comparison with existing methods
In several applications bootstrapping replaces analytical statistics. Block-bootstrapping is applied to serially correlated signals. Noise, ubiquitous in the neurosciences, is typically neglected. Our new approach not only explicitly includes the presence of (observational) noise in the statistics but also outperforms conventional methods and reduces the number of false-positive conclusions.
Conclusions
The presence of noise has impacts on statistical inference. Our ready-to-apply method enables a rigorous statistical assessment based on block-bootstrapping for noisy serially correlated data.},

	abstract = {The presence of fixative-induced and cellular-derived artifactual autofluorescences ({AAFs}) presents a challenge in histological analysis involving immunofluorescence. We have established a simple and highly effective method for the reduction of {AAFs} that are ubiquitous in fixed mammalian brain and other tissues. A compact {AAF}-quenching photo-irradiation device was constructed using a commercially available light emitting diode ({LED}) array, cooling unit, and supporting components. The {LED} panel is comprised of an array of multispectral high intensity {LEDs} which serve as the illumination source for the photo-irradiation process. Rabbit and cat brain specimens of 5 μm- and 40 μm-thicknesses, respectively, were photo-irradiated for various durations. The {AAFs} were reduced to near tissue background levels after 24 h of treatment for both deparaffinized and paraffinized rabbit brain specimens, and for the free-floating cat brain specimens. Subsequent immunofluorescence staining using primary antibodies against {GFAP}, {NeuN}, Iba-1, and {MAP}-2, and the corresponding Qdot® and Alexafluor® fluoroconjugates confirmed that the {LED} photo-irradiation treatment did not compromise the efficiency of the immunofluorescence labeling. The use of the device is not labor intensive, and only requires minimal tissue processing and experimental set-up time, with very low maintenance and operating costs. Finally, multiple specimens, in both slide and well-plate format, can be simultaneously photo-irradiated, thus, allowing for scalable batch processing.},

	abstract = {Summary
Cranioplasty is a procedure commonly performed by plastic surgeons involved in craniofacial surgery, in which it is generally accepted that the ideal reconstructive material is autogenous bone. When this is not available or when its use is inappropriate, alloplastic materials are the next best option. A retrospective analysis was carried out to review the senior author's experience of 98 cranioplasties with methylmethacrylate ({MM}) from 1980 to 2001. The site and size of the implant and complications thereof were recorded and an assessment of the quality of the final result made.

The patients were divided into two groups:

Group 1: Methylmethacrylate as a full thickness inlay.

Group 2: Methylmethacrylate as an onlay only.

In group 1 there were 32 patients for whom the average follow up was 8.2 years (range 2–16 years). In group 2 there were 66 patients with an average follow up of 7.1 years (range 2–20 years). After a minimum follow up of 2 years, 89 out of 98 of the patients retained their implants. Nine implants in total were removed. Of the 89 patients retaining their implants, 85 had excellent or good results at long-term follow up. The infection and implant removal rate was very high if nasal or frontal sinus tissue was in direct contact with the implant during the operative procedure.

The keys to the successful use of methylmethacrylate are discussed and representative case examples are presented. There is increasing evidence that the long term results of newer alternatives to methylmethacrylate for cranioplasty such as hydroxyapatite cement are disappointing and do not justify their expense. Methylmethacrylate is cheap, readily available and easy to use and it remains the alloplastic material of choice for cranioplasty in our hands.},

	abstract = {We have designed a device for long-term head fixation for use in behaving nonhuman primates that is robust yet minimally invasive and simple to use. This device is a modified version of the halo system that is used in humans for cervical traction and stabilization after spinal column injuries. This device consists of an aluminum halo with four titanium skull pins offset from the halo by aluminum posts. The titanium pins insert onto small segments of cranially reinforcing titanium plate, which are attached to the skull with titanium cortex screws. The surgery involves four scalp incisions, placement of the reinforcing plates, insertion of the pins for attachment of the halo, and incision closure. After the halo is attached, the animal's head can be fixed to a primate chair using a custom-built attachment arm that provides three degrees of adjustability for proper positioning during behavioral tasks. We have installed this device on two Macaque monkeys weighing 7 and 10 kg. The halos have been in place on these animals for up to 8 months without signs of discomfort or loss of fixation. Using this method of head fixation, we have been able to track the animals’ eye positions with an accuracy of less than two visual degrees while they perform behavioral tasks.},

To improve the success rate of our head implants, titanium anchor screws, referred to as titanium endosseous implants, were implanted in the skulls of six macaques. Techniques adapted from the processing of dentures were utilized to pre-fabricate an acrylic ‘skull cap’, which provided the mechanical support structure for our study-specific hardware. A two-stage procedure adapted from dentistry (Brånemark et al., 1977) was employed for the placement of titanium endosseous implants in the skull. This two-stage technique incorporates the principles of osseointegration and a healing period. Of the six skull-anchored implants prepared implementing the methods described in this paper, we have not experienced any failures. Additionally, all of the titanium endosseous implants examined post mortem were functionally successful (n=30). Histology results confirmed that there was healthy bone in direct contact with the titanium endosseous implants. The dense cortical bone of the macaque skull is ideal for the implantation of titanium endosseous implants. Titanium endosseous implants have provided secure, functional anchor points for the attachment of hardware to the macaque skull and have resulted in healthy, stable head implants that can remain on the skull for extended periods of time.},

Dural sealants are important to preserve the integrity of the intracranial space after a craniotomy and in prolonging the lifetime and functionality of implanted brain probes. In this study, we report results of our tests on a commercially available silicone gel with unique properties that make it an ideal dural substitute. The substitute is transparent, elastic, easy to apply, and has re-sealing capabilities, which makes it desirable for applications where multiple penetrations by the brain probe is desirable over an extended period of time. Cytotoxicity tests (for up to 10 days) with fibroblasts and in vivo tests (for 12 weeks) show that the gel is non-toxic and does not produce any significant neuronal degeneration when applied to the rodent cortex even after 12 weeks. In vivo humidity testing showed no sign of {CSF} leakage for up to 6 weeks. The gel also allows silicon microprobes to penetrate with forces less than 0.5 {mN}, and a 200-μm diameter stainless steel microprobe with a blunt tip to penetrate with a force less than 2.5 {mN}. The force dependency on the velocity of penetration and thickness of the gel was also quantified and empirically modeled. The above results demonstrate that the silicone gel (3-4680) can be a viable dural substitute in long-term electrophysiology of the brain.},

This paper presents a Matlab-based novel tool, “{SigMate}”, incorporating standard methods to analyze spikes and {EEG} signals, and in-house solutions for local field potentials ({LFPs}) analysis. Available modules at present are – 1. In-house developed algorithms for: data display (2D and 3D), file operations (file splitting, file concatenation, and file column rearranging), baseline correction, slow stimulus artifact removal, noise characterization and signal quality assessment, current source density ({CSD}) analysis, latency estimation from {LFPs} and {CSDs}, determination of cortical layer activation order using {LFPs} and {CSDs}, and single {LFP} clustering; 2. Existing modules: spike detection, sorting and spike train analysis, and {EEG} signal analysis. {SigMate} has the flexibility of analyzing multichannel signals as well as signals from multiple recording sources. The in-house developed tools for {LFP} analysis have been extensively tested with signals recorded using standard extracellular recording electrode, and planar and implantable multi transistor array ({MTA}) based neural probes. {SigMate} will be disseminated shortly to the neuroscience community under the open-source {GNU}-General Public License.},

The present study validates a method for continuous measurement of the local {EP} responses during focal cortical infarction induced via photothrombosis. Single microwire electrodes were acutely implanted into the primary auditory cortex of eight rats. Multi-unit neural activity, evoked via a continuous 2 Hz click stimulus, was recorded before, during and after infarction to assess neuronal function in response to local, permanent ischemia. During sham infarction, the average stimulus-evoked peak firing rate over 20 min remained stable at 495.5 ± 14.5 spikes s –1 , indicating temporal stability of neural function under normal conditions. Stimulus-evoked peak firing was reliably reduced to background levels (firing frequency in the absence of stimulus) following initiation of photothrombosis over a period of 439 ± 92 s. The post-infarction firing patterns exhibited unique temporal degradation of the peak firing rate, suggesting a variable response to ischemic challenge. Despite the inherent complexity of cerebral ischemia secondary to microvascular occlusion, complete loss of {EP} function consistently occurred 300–600 s after photothrombosis. The results suggest that microwire recording during photothrombosis provides a simple and highly efficacious strategy for assessing the electrophysiological dynamics of cortical infarction.},

	abstract = {While neural recording chambers for non-human primates can be purchased commercially, these generic chambers do not contour to the animal's skull. In order to seal gaps, a cap of dental acrylic (methyl methacrylate) is often applied around the chamber. There are multiple disadvantages associated with this method. Applying acrylic delays and further complicates surgical procedure, and overheating during the curing process can cause damage to the bone. Post-surgery, acrylic margins can give rise to bacterial growth and infection. Here we describe a method to develop custom implants which conform to the individual's skull, thereby eliminating the need for acrylic. This method shortens surgery time and significantly improves the hygiene of chamber margins.},

	abstract = {The present study was aimed at developing a new strategy to design and anchor custom-fitted implants, consisting of a head fixation device and a chronic recording chamber, on the skull of adult macaque monkeys. This was done without the use of dental resin or orthopedic cement, as these modes of fixation exert a detrimental effect on the bone. The implants were made of titanium or tekapeek and anchored to the skull with titanium screws. Two adult macaque monkeys were initially implanted with the head fixation device several months previous to electrophysiological investigation, to allow optimal osseous-integration, including growth of the bone above the implant's footplate. In a second step, the chronic recording chamber was implanted above the brain region of interest. The present study proposes two original approaches for both implants. First, based on a {CT} scan of the monkey, a plastic replicate of the skull was obtained in the form of a 3D print, used to accurately shape and position the two implants. This would ensure a perfect match with the skull surface. Second, the part of the implants in contact with the bone was coated with hydroxyapatite, presenting chemical similarity to natural bone, thus promoting excellent osseous-integration. The longevity of the implants used here was 4 years for the head fixation device and 1.5 years for the chronic chamber. There were no adverse events and daily care was easy. This is clear evidence that the present implanting strategy was successful and provokes less discomfort to the animals.},

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00405.2011},
	abstract = {Neurophysiological recording in alert monkeys requires the creation of a permanent aperture in the skull for repeated insertion of microelectrodes. Most laboratories use polymethyl methacrylate to attach a recording chamber over the skull opening. Here, we describe a titanium chamber that fastens to the skull with screws, using no polymethyl methacrylate. The gap between the base of the chamber and the skull is filled with hydroxyapatite, forming a watertight gasket. As the chamber base osseointegates with the skull, the hydroxyapatite is replaced with bone. Rather than having a finite lifetime, the recording chamber becomes more firmly anchored the longer it is in place. It has a small footprint, low profile, and needs little maintenance to control infection. Toilette consists of occasional application of betadine to clean the scalp margin, followed by application of neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ointment. Antibiotic is also placed inside the chamber to suppress bacterial proliferation. Thickening of the dura within the chamber can be prevented by regular application of mitocycin C and/or bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. By conducting an e-mail survey, this protocol for chamber maintenance was compared with procedures used in 37 other vision research laboratories. Refinement of appliances and techniques used for recordings in awake monkeys promises to increase the pace of scientific discovery and to benefit animal welfare.},

However, this requires compact wearable instruments that do not inhibit natural movements. Application of optical potentiometry with voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye using an implantable image sensor is also useful. However, the increasing number of leads required for the multiple wired sensors to measure larger domains inhibits natural behavior. For imaging broad areas by numerous sensors without excessive wiring, a web-like sensor that can wrap the brain was developed. Kaleidoscopic potentiometry is possible using the imaging system with concatenated sensors by changing the alignment of the sensors. This paper describes organization of the system, evaluation of the system by a fluorescence imaging, and finally, functional brain fluorescence plurimetry by the sensor. The recorded data in rat somatosensory cortex using the developed multiple-area imaging system compared well with electrophysiology results.},

In this research, a novel implantable imaging system for fluorescence potentiometry was developed using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ({CMOS}) technology, and its application to the analysis of cultured brain slices and the brain of a living mouse is described. A {CMOS} image sensor, small enough to be implanted into the brain, with light-emitting diodes and an absorbing filter was developed to enable real-time fluorescence imaging. The sensor, in conjunction with a voltage-sensitive dye, was certainly able to visualize the potential statuses of neurons and obtain physiological responses in both right and left visual cortex simultaneously by using multiple sensors for the first time. This accomplished multiplanar and multipoint measurement provides multidimensional information from different aspects. The light microsensors do not disturb the animal behavior. This implies that the imaging system can combine functional fluorescence imaging in the brain with behavioral experiments in a freely moving animal.},

By using a dedicated {CMOS} image sensor, we have successfully imaged and measured brain serine protease activity in vivo, in real-time, and for an extended period of time. We have developed a biofluorescence imaging device by packaging the {CMOS} image sensor which enabled on-chip imaging configuration. In this configuration, no optics are required whereby an excitation filter is applied onto the sensor to replace the filter cube block found in conventional fluorescence microscopes. The fully packaged device measures 350 μm thick × 2.7 mm wide, consists of an array of 176 × 144 pixels, and is small enough for measurement inside a single hemisphere of the mouse brain, while still providing sufficient imaging resolution. In the experiment, intraperitoneally injected kainic acid induced upregulation of serine protease activity in the brain. These events were captured in real time by imaging and measuring the fluorescence from a fluorogenic substrate that detected this activity. The entire device, which weighs less than 1\% of the body weight of the mouse, holds promise for studying freely moving animals.},

An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible homologue of premotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of intermingled neurons predicting ipsi- or contralateral movements, yet unilateral inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within hierarchically organized cortical circuits.},

This paper presents a comparative study of the usage of the linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}) and the naive Bayes ({NB}) classifiers on describing both right- and left-hand movement through electroencephalographic signal ({EEG}) acquisition. For the analysis, we considered the following input features: the energy of the segments of a band pass-filtered signal with the frequency band in sensorimotor rhythms and the components of the spectral energy obtained through the Welch method. We also used the common spatial pattern ({CSP}) filter, so as to increase the discriminatory activity among movement classes. By using the database generated by this experiment, we obtained hit rates up to 70\%. The results are compatible with previous studies.},

Previous research has primarily centered on accurately decoding movement intention from either plan or perimovement activity, but has assumed that temporal boundaries between these epochs are known to the decoding system. In this work, we develop a technique to automatically differentiate between baseline, plan, and perimovement epochs of neural activity. Specifically, we use a generative model of neural activity to capture how neural activity varies between these three epochs. Our approach is based on a hidden Markov model ({HMM}), in which the latent variable (state) corresponds to the epoch of neural activity, coupled with a state-dependent Poisson firing model. Using an {HMM}, we demonstrate that the time of transition from baseline to plan epochs, a transition in neural activity that is not accompanied by any external behavior changes, can be detected using a threshold on the a posteriori {HMM} state probabilities. Following detection of the plan epoch, we show that the intended target of a center-out movement can be detected about as accurately as that by a maximum-likelihood estimator using a window of known plan activity. In addition, we demonstrate that our {HMM} can detect transitions in neural activity corresponding to targets not found in training data. Thus the {HMM} technique for automatically detecting transitions between epochs of neural activity enables prosthetic interfaces that can operate autonomously.},

In this paper, we will pinpoint some caveats regarding the choice of parameters, and give an overview of our own and other researchers' experience with widely used behavioral assessment software.

However, optical stimulation technologies for in vivo need to be developed to match the advances in genetics and biochemistry that have driven this field. In particular, conventional approaches for in vivo optical illumination have a limitation on the achievable spatio-temporal resolution. Here we utilize a sapphire-based microscale gallium nitride light-emitting diode (μ{LED}) probe to activate neocortical neurons in vivo. The probes were designed to contain independently controllable multiple μ{LEDs}, emitting at 450 nm wavelength with an irradiance of up to 2 W/mm2. Monte-Carlo stimulations predicted that optical stimulation using a μ{LED} can modulate neural activity within a localized region. To validate this prediction, we tested this probe in the mouse neocortex that expressed channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) and compared the results with optical stimulation through a fiber at the cortical surface. We confirmed that both approaches reliably induced action potentials in cortical neurons and that the μ{LED} probe evoked strong responses in deep neurons. Due to the possibility to integrate many optical stimulation sites onto a single shank, the μ{LED} probe is thus a promising approach to control neurons locally in vivo.},

	abstract = {Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called “bias”). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

Here we define and develop a set of novel statistical independence tests based on mutual information, which quantify the significance of neural selectivity to either single features or to multiple, potentially correlated stimulus features like those often present in naturalistic stimuli. If the values of different features are correlated during stimulus presentation, it is difficult to establish if one feature is genuinely encoded by the response, or if it instead appears to be encoded only as a side effect of its correlation with another genuinely represented feature. Our tests provide a way to disambiguate between these two possibilities. We use realistic simulations of neural responses tuned to one or more correlated stimulus features to investigate how limited sampling bias correction procedures affect the statistical power of such independence tests, and we characterize the regimes in which the distribution of information values under the null hypothesis can be approximated by simple distributions (Chi-square or Gaussian). Finally, we apply these tests to experimental data to determine the significance of tuning of the band limited power ({BLP}) of the gamma [30–100 Hz] frequency range of the primary visual cortical local field potential to multiple correlated features during presentation of naturalistic movies. We show that gamma {BLP} carries significant, genuine information about orientation, space contrast and time contrast, despite the strong correlations between these features.},

	abstract = {The encoding of sensory information by populations of cortical neurons forms the basis for perception but remains poorly understood. To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker—the neuron's encoding time scale—allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuits may process information using small but highly informative ensembles.},

	abstract = {The rodent whisker-associated thalamic nucleus ({VPM}) contains a somatotopic map where whisker representation is divided into distinct neuronal sub-populations, called “barreloids”. Each barreloid projects to its associated cortical barrel column and so forms a gateway for incoming sensory stimuli to the barrel cortex. We aimed to determine how the population of neurons within one barreloid encodes naturalistic whisker motion. In rats, we recorded the extracellular activity of up to nine single neurons within a single barreloid, by implanting silicon probes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the barreloids. We found that play-back of texture-induced whisker motion evoked sparse responses, timed with millisecond precision. At the population level, there was synchronous activity: however, different subsets of neurons were synchronously active at different times. Mutual information between population responses and whisker motion increased near linearly with population size. When normalized to factor out firing rate differences, we found that texture was encoded with greater informational-efficiency than white noise. These results indicate that, within each {VPM} barreloid, there is a rich and efficient population code for naturalistic whisker motion based on precisely timed, population spike patterns.},

	abstract = {Automatic cell segmentation has various applications in cytometry, and while the nucleus is often very distinct and easy to identify, the cytoplasm provides a lot more challenge. A new combination of image analysis algorithms for segmentation of cells imaged by fluorescence microscopy is presented. The algorithm consists of an image pre\&\#x2010;processing step, a general segmentation and merging step followed by a segmentation quality measurement. The quality measurement consists of a statistical analysis of a number of shape descriptive features. Objects that have features that differ to that of correctly segmented single cells can be further processed by a splitting step. By statistical analysis we therefore get a feedback system for separation of clustered cells. After the segmentation is completed, the quality of the final segmentation is evaluated. By training the algorithm on a representative set of training images, the algorithm is made fully automatic for subsequent images created under similar conditions. Automatic cytoplasm segmentation was tested on {CHO}\&\#x2010;cells stained with calcein. The fully automatic method showed between 89\&\#x25; and 97\&\#x25; correct segmentation as compared to manual segmentation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent advances in genetically engineered calcium and membrane potential indicators provide the potential to estimate the activation dynamics of individual neurons within larger, mesoscale networks (100s-1000+neurons). However, a fully integrated automated workflow for the analysis and visualization of neural microcircuits from high speed fluorescence imaging data is lacking.
{NEW} {METHOD}: Here we introduce {FluoroSNNAP}, Fluorescence Single Neuron and Network Analysis Package. {FluoroSNNAP} is an open-source, interactive software developed in {MATLAB} for automated quantification of numerous biologically relevant features of both the calcium dynamics of single-cells and network activity patterns. {FluoroSNNAP} integrates and improves upon existing tools for spike detection, synchronization analysis, and inference of functional connectivity, making it most useful to experimentalists with little or no programming knowledge.
{RESULTS}: We apply {FluoroSNNAP} to characterize the activity patterns of neuronal microcircuits undergoing developmental maturation in vitro. Separately, we highlight the utility of single-cell analysis for phenotyping a mixed population of neurons expressing a human mutant variant of the microtubule associated protein tau and wild-type tau.
{COMPARISON} {WITH} {EXISTING} {METHOD}(S): We show the performance of semi-automated cell segmentation using spatiotemporal independent component analysis and significant improvement in detecting calcium transients using a template-based algorithm in comparison to peak-based or wavelet-based detection methods. Our software further enables automated analysis of microcircuits, which is an improvement over existing methods.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We expect the dissemination of this software will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of neuronal networks, promoting the rapid interrogation of circuits in health and disease.},

	abstract = {The application of fluorescence microscopy in cell biology often generates a huge amount of imaging data. Automated whole cell segmentation of such data enables the detection and analysis of individual cells, where a manual delineation is often time consuming, or practically not feasible. Furthermore, compared to manual analysis, automation normally has a higher degree of reproducibility. {CellSegm}, the software presented in this work, is a Matlab based command line software toolbox providing an automated whole cell segmentation of images showing surface stained cells, acquired by fluorescence microscopy. It has options for both fully automated and semi-automated cell segmentation. Major algorithmic steps are: (i) smoothing, (ii) Hessian-based ridge enhancement, (iii) marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and (iv) feature-based classfication of cell candidates. Using a wide selection of image recordings and code snippets, we demonstrate that {CellSegm} has the ability to detect various types of surface stained cells in 3D. After detection and outlining of individual cells, the cell candidates can be subject to software based analysis, specified and programmed by the end-user, or they can be analyzed by other software tools. A segmentation of tissue samples with appropriate characteristics is also shown to be resolvable in {CellSegm}. The command-line interface of {CellSegm} facilitates scripting of the separate tools, all implemented in Matlab, offering a high degree of flexibility and tailored workflows for the end-user. The modularity and scripting capabilities of {CellSegm} enable automated workflows and quantitative analysis of microscopic data, suited for high-throughput image based screening.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis techniques provide a powerful means to rapidly and accurately assess complex morphological and functional interactions between neural cells. Current software-based identification methods of neural cells generally fall into two applications: (1) segmentation of cell nuclei in high-density constructs or (2) tracing of cell neurites in single cell investigations. We have developed novel methodologies to permit the systematic identification of populations of neuronal somata possessing rich morphological detail and dense neurite arborization throughout thick tissue or 3-D in vitro constructs. The image analysis incorporates several novel automated features for the discrimination of neurites and somata by initially classifying features in 2-D and merging these classifications into 3-D objects; the 3-D reconstructions automatically identify and adjust for over and under segmentation errors. Additionally, the platform provides for software-assisted error corrections to further minimize error. These features attain very accurate cell boundary identifications to handle a wide range of morphological complexities. We validated these tools using confocal z-stacks from thick 3-D neural constructs where neuronal somata had varying degrees of neurite arborization and complexity, achieving an accuracy of ≥95\%. We demonstrated the robustness of these algorithms in a more complex arena through the automated segmentation of neural cells in ex vivo brain slices. These novel methods surpass previous techniques by improving the robustness and accuracy by: (1) the ability to process neurites and somata, (2) bidirectional segmentation correction, and (3) validation via software-assisted user input. This 3-D image analysis platform provides valuable tools for the unbiased analysis of neural tissue or tissue surrogates within a 3-D context, appropriate for the study of multi-dimensional cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.},

	abstract = {Neural activity manifests itself as complex spatiotemporal activation patterns in cell populations. Even for local neural circuits, a comprehensive description of network activity has been impossible so far. Here we demonstrate that two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-labeled tissue permits dissection of local input and output activities in rat neocortex in vivo. Besides astroglial and neuronal calcium transients, we found spontaneous calcium signals in the neuropil that were tightly correlated to the electrocorticogram. This optical encephalogram ({OEG}) is shown to represent bulk calcium signals in axonal structures, thus providing a measure of local input activity. Simultaneously, output activity in local neuronal populations could be derived from action potential-evoked calcium transients with single-spike resolution. By using these {OEG} and spike activity measures, we characterized spontaneous activity during cortical Up states. We found that (i) spiking activity is sparse ({\textless}0.1 Hz); (ii) on average, only ≈10\% of neurons are active during each Up state; (iii) this active subpopulation constantly changes with time; and (iv) spiking activity across the population is evenly distributed throughout the Up-state duration. Furthermore, the number of active neurons directly depended on the amplitude of the {OEG}, thus optically revealing an input-output function for the local network. We conclude that spontaneous activity in the neocortex is sparse and heterogeneously distributed in space and time across the neuronal population. The dissection of the various signal components in bulk-loaded tissue as demonstrated here will enable further studies of signal flow through cortical networks.},

Corticothalamic slow oscillations of neuronal activity determine internal brain states. At least in the cortex, the electrical activity is associated with large neuronal Ca2+ transients. Here we implemented an optogenetic approach to explore causal features of the generation of slow oscillation-associated Ca2+ waves in the in vivo mouse brain. We demonstrate that brief optogenetic stimulation (3–20 ms) of a local group of layer 5 cortical neurons is sufficient for the induction of global brain Ca2+ waves. These Ca2+ waves are evoked in an all-or-none manner, exhibit refractoriness during repetitive stimulation, and propagate over long distances. By local optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that evoked Ca2+ waves initially invade the cortex, followed by a secondary recruitment of the thalamus. Together, our results establish that synchronous activity in a small cluster of layer 5 cortical neurons can initiate a global neuronal wave of activity suited for long-range corticothalamic integration.},

Specific connectivity may be important for areal specialization, particularly in the mouse, where neighboring neurons are functionally diverse. To examine whether higher visual areas receive functionally specific input from primary visual cortex (V1), we used two-photon calcium imaging to measure responses of axons from V1 arborizing in three areas with distinct spatial and temporal frequency preferences. We found that visual preferences of presynaptic boutons in each area were distinct and matched the average preferences of recipient neurons. This specificity could not be explained by organization within V1 and instead was due to both a greater density and greater response amplitude of functionally matched boutons. Projections from a single layer (layer 5) and from secondary visual cortex were also matched to their target areas. Thus, transmission of specific information to downstream targets may be a general feature of cortico-cortical communication.},

	abstract = {Active dendrites provide neurons with powerful processing capabilities. However, little is known about the role of neuronal dendrites in behaviourally related circuit computations. Here we report that a novel global dendritic nonlinearity is involved in the integration of sensory and motor information within layer 5 pyramidal neurons during an active sensing behaviour. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons possess elaborate dendritic arborizations that receive functionally distinct inputs, each targeted to spatially separate regions. At the cellular level, coincident input from these segregated pathways initiates regenerative dendritic electrical events that produce bursts of action potential output and circuits featuring this powerful dendritic nonlinearity can implement computations based on input correlation. To examine this in vivo we recorded dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the barrel cortex using two-photon calcium imaging in mice performing an object-localization task. Large-amplitude, global calcium signals were observed throughout the apical tuft dendrites when active touch occurred at particular object locations or whisker angles. Such global calcium signals are produced by dendritic plateau potentials that require both vibrissal sensory input and primary motor cortex activity. These data provide direct evidence of nonlinear dendritic processing of correlated sensory and motor information in the mammalian neocortex during active sensation.},

The extent to which single neurons actually change remains largely unstudied, however. To evaluate how functional properties of single neurons change over time, we devised a way to perform in vivo time-lapse electrophysiological recordings from the exact same neuron. We monitored the contralateral and ipsilateral sensory-evoked spiking activity of individual L2/3 neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. At the end of the first recording session, we electroporated the neuron with a {DNA} plasmid to drive {GFP} expression. Then, 2 wk later, we visually guided a recording electrode in vivo to the {GFP}-expressing neuron for the second time. We found that contralateral and ipsilateral evoked responses (i.e., probability to respond, latency, and preference), and spontaneous activity of individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons are stable under control conditions, but that this stability could be rapidly disrupted. Contralateral whisker deprivation induced robust changes in sensory-evoked response profiles of single neurons. Our experiments provide a framework for studying the stability and plasticity of single neurons over long time scales using electrophysiology.},

Through protein structure determination, targeted mutagenesis, high-throughput screening, and a battery of in vitro assays, we have increased the dynamic range of {GCaMP}3 by severalfold, creating a family of “{GCaMP}5” sensors. We tested {GCaMP}5s in several systems: cultured neurons and astrocytes, mouse retina, and in vivo in Caenorhabditis chemosensory neurons, Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction and adult antennal lobe, zebrafish retina and tectum, and mouse visual cortex. Signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 2- to 3-fold. In the visual cortex, two {GCaMP}5 variants detected twice as many visual stimulus-responsive cells as {GCaMP}3. By combining in vivo imaging with electrophysiology we show that {GCaMP}5 fluorescence provides a more reliable measure of neuronal activity than its predecessor {GCaMP}3. {GCaMP}5 allows more sensitive detection of neural activity in vivo and may find widespread applications for cellular imaging in general.},

Erythrocyte (E) complement receptor 1 ({CR}1) is a membrane protein mediating the transport of immune complexes ({ICs}) to phagocytes, and at least three polymorphisms on the {CR}1 gene are related to erythrocyte surface density of {CR}1 molecules, in turn related to the rate of {IC} clearance from circulation. We hypothesized that sarcoidosis could be associated with increased frequency of the {CR}1 gene alleles coding for reduced {CR}1/E ratio. We studied 91 sarcoid patients and two control groups: 94 healthy volunteers and 71 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}). Three polymorphic sites of {CR}1 gene, His1208Arg, intron 27 {HindIII}/{RFLP}, and Pro1827Arg, were analyzed. The three polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium. The {GG} genotype for the Pro1827Arg (C(5507)G) polymorphism was significantly associated with sarcoidosis in comparison to both control groups (odds ratio [{OR}] = 3.13; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.49-6.69 versus healthy control subjects, and {OR}= 2.82, 95\% {CI} 1.27-6.39 versus {COPD} control subjects). The same genotype was particularly associated to disease in females ({OR} = 7.05; 95\% {CI} 3.10-16.61 versus healthy control subjects).

The model of photothermal effect and classical Pennes bio-heat transfer equation were introduced. Finite element method ({FEM}), which was realized by Matlab software, was used to calculate the temperature distribution. He-Ne laser (633 nm) was used to simulate the physical therapy in in vivo skin tissue. Under the cylinder coordinates, the three-dimension (3-D) geometry of tissue was reduced to two-dimension (2-D) computation. The results contained the radial, axial and temperature 3-D color plot. Combining the time animation display was possible. By changing the laser and tissue parameters we can get different results. This will be the initial and indispensable work of the non-destructive evaluation of the laser induced injury.},

A commercially available thermocouple microprobe was modified so that it could be screwed firmly into a guide cannula that had been stereotactically implanted in the brain. Because the microprobe remains firmly in place, it is possible to record continuously for several hours from a single animal. Because the microprobe is easily removed, one can also record intermittently from several animals at once. The necessary equipment is relatively inexpensive and the modified microprobe can be sterilized and reused indefinitely.

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9172258},
	abstract = {This paper starts with definitions of radiance, fluence (rate) and other quantities that are important with regard to in vivo light dosimetry. The light distribution in mammalian tissues can be estimated from model calculations using measured optical properties or from direct measurements of fluence rate using a suitable detector. A historical introduction is therefore followed by a brief discussion of tissue optical properties and of calculations using diffusion theory, the P3-approximation or Monte Carlo simulations. In particular the form of the scattering function is considered in relation to the fluence rate close to the tissue boundary, where light is incident. Non-invasive measurements of optical properties yield the absorption coefficient mu a and mu s(1 - g), where mu s is the scattering coefficient and g is the mean cosine of the scattering angle. An important question is whether this combination is sufficient, or whether g itself must be known. It appears that for strongly forward scattering, as in mammalian tissues, rather detailed knowledge of the scattering function is needed to reliably calculate the fluence rate close to the surface. Deeper in the tissue mu s (1 - g) is sufficient. The construction, calibration and use of fibre-optic probes for measurements of fluence rate in tissues or optical phantoms is discussed. At present, minimally invasive absolute fluence (rate) measurements seem to be possible with an accuracy of 10-20\%. Examples are given of in vivo measurements in animal experiments and in humans during clinical treatments. Measurements in mammalian tissues, plant leaves and marine sediments are compared and similarities and differences pointed out. Most in vivo light fluence rate measurements have been concerned with photodynamic therapy ({PDT}): Optical properties of the same normal tissue may differ between patients. Tumours of the same histological type may even show different optical properties in a single patient. Treatment-induced changes of optical properties may also occur. Scattered light appears to contribute substantially to the light dose. All these phenomena emphasize the importance of in situ light measurements. Another important dosimetric parameter in {PDT} is the concentration and distribution of the photosensitizer. Apart from in vivo fluorescence monitoring, the photosensitizer part of in vivo {PDT} dosimetry is still in its infancy.},

Mathematical expressions, based on random walk analysis of light propagation within tissue slabs, are used to relate the diffuse reflection and transmittance to the absorption coefficient, mu a, and effective scattering coefficient, mu's, for samples of myocardial tissue which were subjected to rapid step changes in temperature. Time-dependent changes in mu's, indicate two processes, one with a fast and temperature-dependent rate the other with a slow and apparently temperature-independent rate. For final temperatures above 56.8 degrees C and for the first 500 s after the temperature change, the optical parameters are well fit by exponential forms that exhibit temperature-dependent time constants as predicted by Arrhenius reaction rate theory of thermal damage. The scattering changes are associated with an apparent activation energy, delta E, of 162 {kJ}/mole and a frequency constant, A, of 3 x 10(23) s-1. This method provides a means for estimating optical coefficients which are needed to assess laser tissue dosimetry.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed.

	abstract = {Local and superficial near-infrared ({NIR}) optical-property characterization of turbid biological tissues can be achieved by measurement of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance at small source–detector separations ({\textless}1.4 mm). However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function γ, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If γ is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3–1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine γ, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration ({FDPM}) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and γ can be measured to within ∓0.005 mm−1, ∓0.05 mm−1, and ∓0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four {NIR} wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and {FDPM} are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm3 in tissues), whereas {FDPM} typically samples larger regions of tissues. Optical-property values for human skull, white matter, scar tissue, optic nerve, and tumors are reported that show distinct absorption and scattering differences between structures and a dependence on the phase-function parameter γ.},

The most intensively studied is 4,16-androstadien-3-one, a chemical which is known to modulate mood and have activational effects in the sympathetic nervous system in a context-dependent manner, but whose action in mate-choice contexts remains largely untested. Here we present evidence that this androgen steroid may modulate women's judgments of men's attractiveness in an ecologically valid context. We tested the effects of androstadienone at a speed-dating event in which men and women interacted in a series of brief dyadic encounters. Men were rated more attractive when assessed by women who had been exposed to androstadienone, an effect that was seen in two out of three studies. The results suggest that androstadienone can influence women's attraction to men, and also that research into the modulatory effects of androstadienone should be made within ecologically valid contexts.},

	abstract = {Many neural disorders are associated with aberrant activity in specific cell types or neural projection pathways embedded within the densely-wired, heterogeneous matter of the brain. An ideal therapy would permit correction of activity just in specific target neurons, while leaving other neurons unaltered. Recently our lab revealed that the naturally-occurring light-activated proteins channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) and halorhodopsin (Halo/{NpHR}) can, when genetically expressed in neurons, enable them to be safely, precisely, and reversibly activated and silenced by pulses of blue and yellow light, respectively. We here describe the ability to make specific neurons in the brain light-sensitive, using a viral approach. We also reveal the design and construction of a scalable, fully-implantable optical prosthetic capable of delivering light of appropriate intensity and wavelength to targeted neurons at arbitrary 3-D locations within the brain, enabling activation and silencing of specific neuron types at multiple locations. Finally, we demonstrate control of neural activity in the cortex of the non-human primate, a key step in the translation of such technology for human clinical use. Systems for optical targeting of specific neural circuit elements may enable a new generation of high-precision therapies for brain disorders.},

There was significant (90\%) attenuation of the light intensity for both 488 nm and 633 nm at a distance of 2.5 mm from the intracerebral laser light-emitting source. At greater distances from the light-emitting source that corresponded to areas in the cerebral cortex, there was greater attenuation of light intensity for increasing distance with 488 nm than with 633 nm because of the increased vascularity of the cortical mantle and absorption of 488 nm by hemoglobin. When hematoporphyrin derivative was given intravascularly, there was increased attenuation of 633 nm through the cerebral cortex that was similar to that seen for 488 nm in normals. Direct assessment of light intensity in living tissue, which we have shown is possible in this report, will aid in our understanding and interpretation of the histological changes that occur following photodynamic therapy.},

The system is based on a simple design, consisting of a microdrive, control electronics, software, and a unique type of recording chamber. The microdrive consists of an aluminum frame, a set of eight linear actuators driven by computer-controlled miniature stepping motors, and two printed circuit boards ({PCBs}) that provide connectivity to the electrodes and the control electronics. The control circuitry is structured around an Atmel {RISC}-based microcontroller, which sends commands to as many as eight motor control cards, each capable of controlling eight motors. The microcontroller is programmed in C and uses serial communication to interface with a host computer. The graphical user interface for sending commands is written in C and runs on a conventional personal computer. The recording chamber is low in profile, mounts within a circular craniotomy, and incorporates a removable internal sleeve. A replaceable Sylastic membrane can be stretched across the bottom opening of the sleeve to provide a watertight seal between the cranial cavity and the external environment. This greatly reduces the susceptibility to infection, nearly eliminates the need for routine cleaning, and permits repeated introduction of electrodes into the brain at the same sites while maintaining the watertight seal. The system is reliable, easy to use, and has several advantages over other commercially available systems with similar capabilities.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer incidence suggests a lifestyle cause. A lifestyle factor used near the breast is the application of antiperspirants/deodorants accompanied by axillary shaving. A previous study did not support a link with breast cancer. If these habits have a role in breast cancer development, women using antiperspirants/deodorants and shaving their underarms frequently would be expected to have an earlier age of diagnosis than those doing so less often. An earlier age of diagnosis would also be expected in those starting to use deodorants and shaving at an earlier age. This is the first study to investigate the intensity of underarm exposure in a cohort of breast cancer survivors. Four hundred and thirty-seven females diagnosed with breast cancer were surveyed. Once grouped by their frequency of underarm hygiene habits, the mean age of diagnosis was the primary end point. Secondary end points included the overall frequency of these habits, and potential usage group confounding variables were evaluated. All statistical tests were two-sided. Frequency and earlier onset of antiperspirant/deodorant usage with underarm shaving were associated with an earlier age of breast cancer diagnosis. Combined habits are likely for this earlier age of diagnosis. In conclusion, underarm shaving with antiperspirant/deodorant use may play a role in breast cancer. It is not clear which of these components are involved. Reviewed literature insinuates absorption of aluminium salts facilitated by dermal barrier disruption. Case-controlled investigations are needed before alternative underarm hygiene habits are suggested.},

	abstract = {Although risk factors are known to include the loss of function of the susceptibility genes {BRCA}1/{BRCA}2 and lifetime exposure to oestrogen, the main causative agents in breast cancer remain unaccounted for. It has been suggested recently that underarm cosmetics might be a cause of breast cancer, because these cosmetics contain a variety of chemicals that are applied frequently to an area directly adjacent to the breast. The strongest supporting evidence comes from unexplained clinical observations showing a disproportionately high incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, just the local area to which these cosmetics are applied. A biological basis for breast carcinogenesis could result from the ability of the various constituent chemicals to bind to {DNA} and to promote growth of the damaged cells. Multidisciplinary research is now needed to study the effect of long-term use of the constituent chemicals of underarm cosmetics, because if there proves to be any link between these cosmetics and breast cancer then there might be options for the prevention of breast cancer.

	abstract = {Based on the observation of a high incidence of breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant adjacent to the usual area of application of deodorants and/or antiperspirants, several scientific teams have advanced the hypothesis of a possible link between antiperspirants and breast cancer. The possibility of the involvement of parabens and aluminium salts, traditional components of a number of cosmetic products, has been advanced by the same teams. In order to ascertain whether this hypothesis could or could not be confirmed, a group of clinical experts in oncology was set up to search and analyse the literature data relating to the problem raised with the aim of answering three predefined questions: 1) does it exist experimental or biological arguments supporting a potential link between the use of deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer? 2) Does the use of deodorants/antiperspirants have any effect on the increase in the risk of breast cancer? 3) Could a causal relationship between the use of deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer be accepted? The scientific data were searched systematically in the {PubMed} database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) using standardised search equations. Fifty-nine studies resulting from the literature search were reviewed and nineteen articles with various methodologies were selected for in-depth analysis. In view of the fact that parabens are generally not present in deodorants/antiperspirants, the reflection group's search related purely to the question of aluminium salts. Among these nineteen articles, many are methodologically unsound, do not answer to the questions posed or deal with the question of parabens and were therefore discarded by the reflection group. The expert group's conclusion coincides with those of the French, European and American health authorities. After analysis of the available literature on the subject, no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis was identified and no validated hypothesis appears likely to open the way to interesting avenues of research.},

In contrast, little is known about our ability to select communicative actions, i.e., actions directly designed to modify the mental state of another agent. We have recently provided novel empirical evidence for a mechanism in which a communicator selects his actions on the basis of a prediction of the communicative intentions that an addressee is most likely to attribute to those actions. The main novelty of those findings was that this prediction of intention recognition is cerebrally implemented within the intention recognition system of the communicator, is modulated by the ambiguity in meaning of the communicative acts, and not by their sensorimotor complexity. The characteristics of this predictive mechanism support the notion that human communicative abilities are distinct from both sensorimotor and linguistic processes.},

	abstract = {Previously we have reported a near-infrared optical response in the region occupied by a peripheral nerve that is distal to the site of electrical stimulation of that peripheral nerve. This “intermediate” signal is vascular in nature but its biological origin not been elucidated. In the present study, an animal model of the signal has been created and our human studies expanded to directly investigate the contribution of non-artifactual vascular motion induced by muscle contraction to the biological origin of this signal. Under non-invasive conditions during stimulation of the exposed sciatic nerve of the Sprague-Dawley rat, optical responses are robust. These signals can be abolished both pharmacologically and surgically using methods that eliminate muscle motion while leaving the electrophysiological health of the nerve intact. In human studies, signals that are elicited on stimulation of nerves containing motor axons, both within and outside the predicted imaging volume of the spectrometer, have similar temporal characteristics of those previously observed. Moreover, stimulation of sensory nerves alone does not elicit an optical response. These results strongly suggest that the intermediate signals are derived from stimulus-induced muscle contraction (whether via an innervating nerve or by direct stimulation) causing translational vascular motion within the optically interrogated region.},

	shorttitle = {Quantitative investigation of the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in diffuse optical imaging},
	abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging ({DOI}) is a non invasive technique allowing the recovery of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, {DOI} measurements are subject to partial volume errors. {DOI} measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on {DOI} measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin concentrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10\%.},

The mean penetration depth of diffusely reflected photons is dependent on the arrival time of photons, but not on the source–detector distance. Thus, time-encoded data can be used to recover depth information while photon exiting point is exploited for lateral localization. This approach was tested against simulations, demonstrating both detection and localization capabilities. Preliminary measurements on inhomogeneous phantoms showed good detection sensibility, even for a low optical perturbation, and localization capabilities, yet with decreasing spatial resolution for increasing depths. Potential application of this method to in vivo functional studies on the brain is discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the design and the experimental results of a fully integrated, low-noise, low-power standard {CMOS} preamplifier circuit used to record the extracellular electrophysiological activity of in vitro biological neuronal cultures. Our goal is to use the preamplifier in a fully integrated, multi-channel, bi-directional neuro-electronic interface.
Among others, two main requirements must be addressed when designing such kind of integrated recording systems: noise performance and very low frequency disturbance rejection. These two requirements need to be satisfied together with a small silicon area design, to be able to integrate a large number of recording channels (i.e. up to thousands) onto a single die. A prototype preamplifier circuit has been designed and implemented; in this paper we report the experimental results.
While satisfying the above requirements, our circuit offers state-of-the-art smallest area occupation (0.13 mm2) and consumes 4.5 [mu]W. Sub-threshold-biased lateral pnp transistors, used to implement very high resistance value integrated resistors, have been characterized to determine the resistance spread.
The fabricated prototype, coupled with a commercial Micro-Electrode Array ({MEA}), has been successfully employed to record the extracellular electrophysiological spontaneous activity, both of muscular cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) and of spinal cord neurons from murines.},

Using the somatosensory thalamocortical slice, we determined that the spatial resolution of {FA} is ≥100–200 μm and that the sensitivity for detecting thalamocortical synaptic activity approximates that of whole cell recording. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors with {DNQX} and {AP}5 abolished cortical responses to electrical thalamic stimulation. The combination of {FA} with photostimulation using caged glutamate revealed robust long-distance connectivity patterns that could be readily assessed in slices from the somatosensory, auditory, and visual systems that contained thalamocortical, corticothalamic, or corticocortical connections. We mapped the projection from theventral posterior nucleus of thalamus ({VPM}) to the primary somatosensory cortex-barrel field and confirmed topography that had been previously described using more laborious methods. We also produced a novel map of the projections from the {VPM} to the thalamic reticular nucleus, showing precise topography along the dorsoventral axis. Importantly, only about 30 s were needed to generate the connectivity map (six stimulus locations). These data suggest that {FA} is a sensitive tool for exploring and measuring connectivity and, when coupled with glutamate photostimulation, can rapidly map long-range projections in a single animal.},

If flavoproteins are photobleached, neural activities may be affected owing to dysfunction in aerobic energy metabolism in mitochondria. We tested this possibility in cortical slices from mice, and found that exposure to blue light ([lambda] = 475 nm) derived from a 20 {mW} diode laser for 50 min suppresses trans-synaptic components of field potentials. This finding formed the basis of a transcranial photo-inactivation technique, that was used to investigate auditory signal transmission between the anterior auditory field ({AAF}) and the primary auditory cortex ({AI}) in anesthetized mice. Cortical responses in {AAF} and {AI}, elicited by 5 {kHz} tonal stimuli, were visualized using transcranial flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. After determining responsive areas in {AAF} and {AI}, the auditory cortex was exposed to the blue diode laser via the intact skull, while either {AAF} or {AI} was protected with a piece of carbon paper. Although the photo-inactivation of {AI} had no significant effect on the fluorescence responses in {AAF}, the photo-inactivation of {AAF} significantly reduced the fluorescence responses in {AI}, indicating the presence of auditory signal transmission from {AAF} to {AI}.},

	abstract = {A major characteristic of neural networks is the complexity of their organization at various spatial scales, from microscopic local circuits to macroscopic brain-scale areas. Understanding how neural information is processed thus entails the ability to study them at multiple scales simultaneously. This is made possible using microelectrodes array ({MEA}) technology. Indeed, high-density {MEAs} provide large-scale coverage (several square millimeters) of whole neural structures combined with microscopic resolution (about 50 μm) of unit activity. Yet, current options for spatiotemporal representation of {MEA}-collected data remain limited. Here we present {NeuroMap}, a new interactive Matlab-based software for spatiotemporal mapping of {MEA} data. {NeuroMap} uses thin plate spline interpolation, which provides several assets with respect to conventional mapping methods used currently. First, any {MEA} design can be considered, including 2D or 3D, regular or irregular, arrangements of electrodes. Second, spline interpolation allows the estimation of activity across the tissue with local extrema not necessarily at recording sites. Finally, this interpolation approach provides a straightforward analytical estimation of the spatial Laplacian for better current sources localization. In this software, coregistration of 2D {MEA} data on the anatomy of the neural tissue is made possible by fine matching of anatomical data with electrode positions using rigid-deformation-based correction of anatomical pictures. Overall, {NeuroMap} provides substantial material for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of {MEA} data.

	abstract = {The ability to silence the activity of genetically specified neurons in a temporally precise fashion would provide the opportunity to investigate the causal role of specific cell classes in neural computations, behaviours and pathologies. Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 {pA} at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because {pH} excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue–green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of ‘optogenetic’ voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the {EEG} a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in {EEG} activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 {EEG} sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process {EEG} in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92\%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92\% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10\% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial {EEG} analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.},

Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that {DBS} may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on {DBS} and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens ({NAc}), subthalamic nucleus ({STN}), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: {NAc} and {STN}. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the {NAc} is currently the most promising {DBS} target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The {mPFC} is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in {DBS} research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with {DBS} in patients with addiction.},

The advent of neuroleptics led to a drastic decline in psychosurgery for several decades. Functional stereotactic neurosurgery has recently been revitalized, starting with treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) facilitates reversible focal neuromodulation of altered basal ganglia circuits. {DBS} is now being extended to treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder, depression and addiction. In this review, we discuss the concept that dysfunction of motor, limbic and associative cortico-basal ganglia–thalamocortical loops underlies these various disorders, which might now be amenable to {DBS} treatment.},

	abstract = {Objective:  
  A prevalence of at least 30\% for treatment-resistant depression has prompted the investigation of alternative treatment strategies. Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) is a promising targeted approach involving the bilateral placement of electrodes at specific neuroanatomical sites. Given the invasive and experimental nature of {DBS} for treatment-resistant depression, it is important to obtain both short-term and long-term effectiveness and safety data. This report represents an extended follow-up of 20 patients with treatment-resistant depression who received {DBS} to the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 25).Method:  
  After an initial 12-month study of {DBS}, patients were seen annually and at a last follow-up visit to assess depression severity, functional outcomes, and adverse events.Results:  
  The average response rates 1, 2, and 3 years after {DBS} implantation were 62.5\%, 46.2\%, and 75\%, respectively. At the last follow-up visit (range=3—6 years), the average response rate was 64.3\%. Functional impairment in the areas of physical health and social functioning progressively improved up to the last follow-up visit. No significant adverse events were reported during this follow-up, although two patients died by suicide during depressive relapses.Conclusions:  
  These data suggest that in the long term, {DBS} remains a safe and effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression. Additional trials with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.Abstract Teaser},

Treatment-resistant depression is a severely disabling disorder with no proven treatment options once multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy have failed. Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate {BA}25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.},

	abstract = {Context  
    A 2-day consensus conference was held to examine scientific and ethical issues in the application of deep brain stimulation for treating mood and behavioral disorders, such as major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome.Objectives  
    The primary objectives of the conference were to (1) establish consensus among participants about the design of future clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and (2) develop standards for the protection of human subjects participating in such studies.Results  
    Conference participants identified 16 key points for guiding research in this growing field.Conclusions  
    The adoption of the described guidelines would help to protect the safety and rights of research subjects who participate in clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and have further potential to benefit other stakeholders in the research process, including clinical researchers and device manufactures. That said, the adoption of the guidelines will require broad and substantial commitment from many of these same stakeholders.},

Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.},

Despite representing less than 1\% of local neurons, these cholinergic cells have dominant control roles, exerting powerful modulation of circuit activity. Furthermore, these neurons could be activated by cocaine, and silencing this drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure (despite the fact that the manipulation of the cholinergic interneurons was not aversive by itself) blocked cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals.},

Inspired by the ability of communication to improve targeting in biological systems, such as inflammatory-cell recruitment to sites of disease, we construct systems where synthetic biological and nanotechnological components communicate to amplify disease targeting in vivo. These systems are composed of ‘signalling’ modules (nanoparticles or engineered proteins) that target tumours and then locally activate the coagulation cascade to broadcast tumour location to clot-targeted ‘receiving’ nanoparticles in circulation that carry a diagnostic or therapeutic cargo, thereby amplifying their delivery. We show that communicating nanoparticle systems can be composed of multiple types of signalling and receiving modules, can transmit information through multiple molecular pathways in coagulation, can operate autonomously and can target over 40 times higher doses of chemotherapeutics to tumours than non-communicating controls.},

	abstract = {Becoming aware of errors that one has committed might be crucial for strategic behavioral and neuronal adjustments to avoid similar errors in the future. This review addresses conscious error perception (“error awareness”) in healthy subjects as well as the relationship between error awareness and neurological and psychiatric diseases. We first discuss the main findings on error awareness in healthy subjects. A brain region, that appears consistently involved in error awareness processes, is the insula, which also provides a link to the clinical conditions reviewed here. Then we focus on a neurological condition whose core element is an impaired awareness for neurological consequences of a disease: anosognosia for hemiplegia ({AHP}). The insular cortex has been implicated in both error awareness and {AHP}, with anterior insular regions being involved in conscious error processing and more posterior areas being related to {AHP}. In addition to cytoarchitectonic and connectivity data, this reflects a functional and structural gradient within the insula from anterior to posterior. Furthermore, studies dealing with error awareness and lack of insight in a number of psychiatric diseases are reported. Especially in schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, ({ADHD}) and autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}) the performance monitoring system seems impaired, thus conscious error perception might be altered.},

Transcriptional circuits are layered by using promoters to carry the signal between circuits. In other words, the output promoter of one circuit serves as the input promoter to the next. Thus, connecting circuits requires physically connecting a promoter to the next circuit. We show that the sequence at the junction between the input promoter and circuit can affect the input-output response (transfer function) of the circuit. A library of putative sequences that might reduce (or buffer) such context effects, which we refer to as 'insulator parts', is screened in Escherichia coli. We find that ribozymes that cleave the 5′ untranslated region (5′-{UTR}) of the {mRNA} are effective insulators. They generate quantitatively identical transfer functions, irrespective of the identity of the input promoter. When these insulators are used to join synthetic gene circuits, the behavior of layered circuits can be predicted using a mathematical model. The inclusion of insulators will be critical in reliably permuting circuits to build different programs.},

The target for {DBS} and the stimulation parameters to be used are unknown. Here, we implanted bilateral electrodes in the vicinity of the fornix, a key element of the memory circuitry, and applied {DBS} with different stimulation frequencies and amplitudes in an experimental model of dementia. Rats received scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, to mimic memory impairment. Rats were then tested in the object location task with the following conditions: (i) with attachment of stimulation cable (off stimulation), and (ii) with {DBS} at various amplitudes (50 μA, 100 μA and 200 μA), 100 μs pulse width and 100 Hz or 10 Hz stimulation frequency. {DBS} reversed the memory impairing effects of scopolamine when compared to sham rats. We found that the fornix is not sensitive to the frequency of stimulation, but rather to current levels. With the most optimal stimulation parameter, we found no side-effects on anxiety levels and general motor activity. These findings identify the fornix as a key region in controlling spatial memory functions. {DBS} of this region, using tailored stimulation parameters, has the potential to improve memory functions in conditions characterised by memory impairment.},

Conclusuions 
Evidence for the use of {DBS} to treat dementia is preliminary and limited.

Whereas the wide variety of involuntary behaviors (and here mostly the deviant or pathological ones will be considered) will necessarily be represented at some biophysical level in nervous system activity–for after all those cellular activity patterns manifest themselves as behaviors and thus there will be a multiplicity of them–there could be some general tendencies to be discerned amongst that assortment. Collecting observations derived from neurophysiological activity associated with several pathological conditions characterized by presenting will-less actions such as Parkinson's disease, seizures, alien hand syndrome and tics, it is proposed that a general neurophysiologic tendency of brain activity that correlates with involuntary actions is higher than normal synchrony in specific brain cell networks, depending upon the behavior in question. Wilful, considered normal behavior, depends on precise coordination of the collective activity in cell ensembles that may be lost, or diminished, when there are tendencies toward more than normal or aberrant synchronization of cellular activity. Hence, rapid fluctuations in synchrony is associated with normal actions and cognition while less variability in brain recordings particularly with regards to synchronization could be a signature of unconscious and deviant behaviors in general.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed. However, we demonstrate here that, when proper measures are taken to handle the various sources of temporal error, accuracy can be achieved at the 1 ms time-scale that is relevant for the alignment of behavioral and neural events.},

Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light.  Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus.  We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain {TP}009, which we named {ArchT}, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch ({\textasciitilde}900 {pA}), but with a {\textgreater}3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, equating to {\textgreater}2x increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber (notably, in the typical optogenetic range of 1-10 {mW}/mm2).  Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, {ArchT} expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons.  The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore {ArchT} function in the cortex of the rhesus macaque.  Optical perturbation of {ArchT}-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete ({\textasciitilde}100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/sec upon illumination.  A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing.  The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that {ArchT} silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

Smoking and overeating are compulsory habits that are difficult to stop. Several studies have shown involvement of the nucleus accumbens in these and other addictive behaviors. In this case report, we describe a patient who quit smoking and lost weight without any effort, and we review the underlying mechanisms of action.


{CLINICAL} {PRESENTATION}

A 47-year-old woman presented with chronic treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, nicotine dependence, and obesity.


{INTERVENTION}

The patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Unintended, effortless, and simultaneous smoking cessation and weight loss were observed.


{CONCLUSION}

This study supports the idea of compulsivity with common circuitry in the processing of diverse rewards and suggests that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens could be a possible treatment of patients with a dependency not responding to currently available treatments.},

	abstract = {Background 
We investigated the use of deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum ({VC}/{VS}) for treatment refractory depression. 
Methods 
Fifteen patients with chronic, severe, highly refractory depression received open-label {DBS} at three collaborating clinical sites. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the {VC}/{VS} region. Stimulation was titrated to therapeutic benefit and the absence of adverse effects. All patients received continuous stimulation and were followed for a minimum of 6 months to longer than 4 years. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale—24 item ({HDRS}), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ({MADRS}), and the Global Assessment of Function Scale ({GAF}). 
Results 
Significant improvements in depressive symptoms were observed during {DBS} treatment. Mean {HDRS} scores declined from 33.1 at baseline to 17.5 at 6 months and 14.3 at last follow-up. Similar improvements were seen with the {MADRS} (34.8, 17.9, and 15.7, respectively) and the {GAF} (43.4, 55.5, and 61.8, respectively). Responder rates with the {HDRS} were 40\% at 6 months and 53.3\% at last follow-up ({MADRS}: 46.7\% and 53.3\%, respectively). Remission rates were 20\% at 6 months and 40\% at last follow-up with the {HDRS} ({MADRS}: 26.6\% and 33.3\%, respectively). The {DBS} was well-tolerated in this group.

Deep brain stimulation of the {VC}/{VS} offers promise for the treatment of refractory major depression.},

Despite the availability of software that allows the coding of behavioral tasks in high-level programming environments, many researchers are still reluctant to trust the temporal accuracy and resolution of programs running in such environments, especially when they run atop non-real-time operating systems. Thus, the creation of behavioral paradigms has been slowed by the intricacy of the coding required and their dissemination across labs has been hampered by the various types of hardware needed. However, we demonstrate here that, when proper measures are taken to handle the various sources of temporal error, accuracy can be achieved at the 1 ms time-scale that is relevant for the alignment of behavioral and neural events.},

For example, early detection of an epileptic seizure from sequential electroencephalographic ({EEG}) measurements would allow timely administration of anticonvulsant drugs or neurostimulation, thus reducing physical impairment and risks of overtreatment. We develop a Bayesian paradigm for state transition detection that combines optimal control and Markov processes. We define a hidden Markov model of the state evolution and develop a detection policy that minimizes a loss function of both probability of false positives and accuracy (i.e., lag between estimated and actual transition time). Our strategy automatically adapts to each newly acquired measurement based on the state evolution model and the relative loss for false positives and accuracy, thus resulting in a time varying threshold policy. The paradigm was used in two applications: 1) detection of movement onset (behavioral state) from subthalamic single unit recordings in Parkinson's disease patients performing a motor task; 2) early detection of an approaching seizure (clinical state) from multichannel intracranial {EEG} recordings in rodents treated with pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant. Our paradigm performs significantly better than chance and improves over widely used detection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Learning can be motivated by unanticipated success or unexpected failure. The former encourages us to repeat an action or activity, whereas the latter leads us to find an alternative strategy. Understanding the neural representation of these unexpected events is therefore critical to elucidate learning-related circuits. We examined the activity of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) and caudate nucleus of monkeys as they performed a trial-and-error learning task. Unexpected outcomes were widely represented in both structures, and neurons driven by unexpectedly negative outcomes were as frequent as those activated by unexpectedly positive outcomes. Moreover, both positive and negative reward prediction errors ({RPEs}) were represented primarily by increases in firing rate, unlike the manner in which dopamine neurons have been observed to reflect these values. Interestingly, positive {RPEs} tended to appear with shorter latency than negative {RPEs}, perhaps reflecting the mechanism of their generation. Last, in the {PFC} but not the caudate, trial-by-trial variations in outcome-related activity were linked to the animals' subsequent behavioral decisions. More broadly, the robustness of {RPE} signaling by these neurons suggests that actor-critic models of reinforcement learning in which the {PFC} and particularly the caudate are considered primarily to be “actors” rather than “critics,” should be reconsidered to include a prominent evaluative role for these structures.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) has emerged as a safe, effective, and reversible treatment for a number of movement disorders. This has prompted investigation of its use for other applications including psychiatric disorders. In recent years, {DBS} has been introduced for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder ({OCD}), which is characterized by recurrent unwanted thoughts or ideas (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in order to relieve these obsessions (compulsions). Abnormal activity in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical ({CSTC}) circuits including the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}), anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), ventral striatum, and mediodorsal ({MD}) thalamus has been implicated in {OCD}. To this end a number of {DBS} targets including the anterior limb of the internal capsule ({ALIC}), ventral capsule/ventral striatum ({VC}/{VS}), ventral caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus ({STN}), and nucleus accumbens ({NAc}) have been investigated for the treatment of {OCD}. Despite its efficacy and widespread use in movement disorders, the mechanism of {DBS} is not fully understood, especially as it relates to psychiatric disorders. While initially thought to create a functional lesion akin to ablative procedures, it is increasingly clear that {DBS} may induce clinical benefit through activation of axonal fibers spanning the {CSTC} circuits, alteration of oscillatory activity within this network, and/or release of critical neurotransmitters. In this article we review how the use of {DBS} for {OCD} informs our understanding of both the mechanisms of {DBS} and the circuitry of {OCD}. We review the literature on {DBS} for {OCD} and discuss potential mechanisms of action at the neuronal level as well as the broader circuit level.},

	abstract = {The ability to optimize behavioural performance when confronted with continuously evolving environmental demands is a key element of human cognition. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}), which lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes, is important in regulating cognitive control. Hypotheses about its function include guiding reward-based decision making, monitoring for conflict between competing responses and predicting task difficulty. Precise mechanisms of {dACC} function remain unknown, however, because of the limited number of human neurophysiological studies. Here we use functional imaging and human single-neuron recordings to show that the firing of individual {dACC} neurons encodes current and recent cognitive load. We demonstrate that the modulation of current {dACC} activity by previous activity produces a behavioural adaptation that accelerates reactions to cues of similar difficulty to previous ones, and retards reactions to cues of different difficulty. Furthermore, this conflict adaptation, or Gratton effect, is abolished after surgically targeted ablation of the {dACC}. Our results demonstrate that the {dACC} provides a continuously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand to optimize future behavioural responses. In situations with stable cognitive demands, this signal promotes efficiency by hastening responses, but in situations with changing demands it engenders accuracy by delaying responses.},

Eighteen dancers recorded their menstrual periods, work shifts, and tip earnings for 60 days on a study web site. A mixed-model analysis of 296 work shifts (representing about 5300 lap dances) showed an interaction between cycle phase and hormonal contraception use. Normally cycling participants earned about {US}\$335 per 5-h shift during estrus, {US}\$260 per shift during the luteal phase, and {US}\$185 per shift during menstruation. By contrast, participants using contraceptive pills showed no estrous earnings peak. These results constitute the first direct economic evidence for the existence and importance of estrus in contemporary human females, in a real-world work setting. These results have clear implications for human evolution, sexuality, and economics.},

Accordingly, the federal government and the states have enacted laws that permit law enforcement to identify offenders and to apply various levels of sanctions. There is no constitutional requirement that evidence of drunkenness be permitted in defense of criminal behavior. In practice, citizens who undertake to operate motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol are considered reckless per se and have no right to obstruct law enforcement in determining their condition. Indeed, refusal of roadside sobriety tests, including the Breathalyzer, may be considered a separate offense. The issuing of Miranda-type warnings by police officers has been ruled on recently in New Jersey. In a superior court appellate decision, State v. Spell, the court outlined the necessary procedures, concluding that, although motorists have no right to refuse testing, police officers have an obligation to issue sufficient warnings before the motorist decides how to proceed. In the Spell matter, the defendant incriminated himself by refusing the testing, even though he was acquitted on the drunk-driving charge.

This generalization holds across professions that might be expected to show greater accuracy. Structured assessment instruments based on observable signs have shown promise but are confounded by the wide variations between casual social drinkers and those that have obtained a high level of tolerance. Among sobriety tests, only {NHTSA}'s Standardized Field Sobriety Tests ({SFSTs}) have substantial, but seriously flawed, research support. Assessing the sobriety of strangers in the low to moderate {BAC} ranges without resort to chemical tests remains a daunting task. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We created a genetically encoded, optically controlled pacemaker by expressing halorhodopsin and channelrhodopsin in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. Using patterned illumination in a selective plane illumination microscope, we located the pacemaker and simulated tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular blocks, and cardiac arrest. The pacemaker converges to the sinoatrial region during development and comprises fewer than a dozen cells by the time the heart loops. Perturbation of the activity of these cells was entirely reversible, demonstrating the resilience of the endogenous pacemaker. Our studies combine optogenetics and light-sheet microscopy to reveal the emergence of organ function during development.},

Plus rarement, il s'agit de myocardite ou {myopÃ}©ricardite Ã  expression plus globale avec douleurs, troubles de repolarisation, pouvant simuler un infarctus du myocarde, donner des troubles du rythme, des anomalies Ã©chographiques ventriculaires et/ou {pÃ}©ricardiques, et {mÃªme} une insuffisance cardiaque, et Ã©voluant le plus souvent vers la {guÃ}©rison {spontanÃ}©e, le {rÃ}´le de l'{antibiothÃ}©rapie dans l'obtention de la {guÃ}©rison est {suggÃ}©{rÃ}©.

Cardiac manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis are relatively infrequent, occurring within weeks after the infectious tick bite (median of 21Â days), and resulting at this stage from a direct borrelial infection of the myocardium, as indicated by reports of spirochete isolation from pericardium and myocardium. They may persist or appear in the late, tertiary phase of the illness, being then more likely due to infection-triggered autoimmunity. Lyme carditis typically presents with a fluctuating degree of atrioventricular block that spontaneously resolves in several days. Rarely, myocarditis may occur with or without pericardial involvement, in patients presenting with chest pain, {ST} depression or T wave inversion, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, and various arrhythmias are reported, as well as pericardial effusion or heart failure. A complete recovery is usually observed, spontaneous or after antibiotherapy. Severe myocarditis or Pericarditis leading to death is exceptional. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is based on the same association of clinical and laboratory features as in Lyme disease without cardiac involvement. But the occurrence of conduction disturbances in healthy young people suggests screening for other criteria of Lyme disease. The management of Lyme carditis does not differ from the treatment of Lyme disease without carditis and is mainly based upon the use of doxycycline or ceftriaxone.},

	abstract = {Drug addiction is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by loss of control over motivated behavior. The need for effective treatments mandates a greater understanding of the causes and identification of new therapeutic targets for drug development. Drugs of abuse subjugate normal reward-related behavior to uncontrollable drug-seeking and -taking. Contributions of brain reward circuitry are being mapped with increasing precision. The role of synaptic plasticity in addiction and underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation of the addicted state are being delineated. Thus we may now consider the role of striatal signal transduction in addiction from a more integrative neurobiological perspective. Drugs of abuse alter dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in medium spiny neurons of the striatum. Dopamine receptors important for reward serve as principle targets of drugs abuse, which interact with glutamate receptor signaling critical for reward learning. Complex networks of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms underlying these receptors are strongly stimulated by addictive drugs. Through these mechanisms, repeated drug exposure alters functional and structural neuroplasticity, resulting in transition to the addicted biological state and behavioral outcomes that typify addiction. Ca2+ and {cAMP} represent key second messengers that initiate signaling cascades, which regulate synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity that are dysregulated by drugs of abuse. Increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which protein kinases and phosphatases exert their effects during normal reward learning and the addiction process may lead to novel targets and pharmacotherapeutics with increased efficacy in promoting abstinence and decreased side effects, such as interference with natural reward, for drug addiction.},

Methods and Results—We demonstrate the utility of optogenetics to cardiac muscle by a tandem cell unit ({TCU}) strategy, where non-excitable cells carry exogenous light-sensitive ion channels, and when electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes, produce optically-excitable heart tissue. A stable channelrhodopsin2 ({ChR}2) expressing cell line was developed, characterized and used as a cell delivery system. The {TCU} strategy was validated in vitro in cell pairs with adult canine myocytes (for a wide range of coupling strengths) and in cardiac syncytium with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. For the first time, we combined optical excitation and optical imaging to capture light-triggered muscle contractions and high-resolution propagation maps of light-triggered electrical waves, found to be quantitatively indistinguishable from electrically-triggered waves. Conclusions—Our results demonstrate feasibility to control excitation and contraction in cardiac muscle by light using the {TCU} approach. Optical pacing in this case uses less energy, offers superior spatiotemporal control, remote access and can serve not only as an elegant tool in arrhythmia research, but may form the basis for a new generation of light-driven cardiac pacemakers and muscle actuators.

The recent development of neural photosensitization tools, such as channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2), offers new opportunities for non-invasive, flexible and cell-specific neuronal stimulation. Previously, complex spatiotemporal control of photosensitized neurons has been limited by the lack of appropriate optical devices which can provide 2D stimulation with sufficient irradiance. Here we present a simple and powerful solution that is based on an array of high-power micro light-emitting diodes (micro-{LEDs}) that can generate arbitrary optical excitation patterns on a neuronal sample with micrometre and millisecond resolution. We first describe the design and fabrication of the system and characterize its capabilities.

This technique enables precise optical stimulation of neurons and simultaneous monitoring of neural response by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We previously demonstrated, in vitro, the dual capability (optical delivery and electrical recording) while testing a novel hybrid device (optrode-{MEA}), which incorporates a tapered coaxial optical electrode (optrode) and a 100 element microelectrode array ({MEA}). Here we report a fully chronic implant of a new version of this device in {ChR}2-expressing rats, and demonstrate its use in freely moving animals over periods up to 8 months. In its present configuration, we show the device delivering optical excitation to a single cortical site while mapping the neural response from the surrounding 30 channels of the 6 × 6 element {MEA}, thereby enabling recording of optically modulated single-unit and local field potential activity across several millimeters of the neocortical landscape.},

	abstract = {Optogenetics, the ability to use light to activate and silence specific neuron types within neural networks in vivo and in vitro, is revolutionizing neuroscientists' capacity to understand how defined neural circuit elements contribute to normal and pathological brain functions. Typically, awake behaving experiments are conducted by inserting an optical fiber into the brain, tethered to a remote laser, or by utilizing an implanted light-emitting diode ({LED}), tethered to a remote power source. A fully wireless system would enable chronic or longitudinal experiments where long duration tethering is impractical, and would also support high-throughput experimentation. However, the high power requirements of light sources ({LEDs}, lasers), especially in the context of the extended illumination periods often desired in experiments, precludes battery-powered approaches from being widely applicable. We have developed a headborne device weighing 2 g capable of wirelessly receiving power using a resonant {RF} power link and storing the energy in an adaptive supercapacitor circuit, which can algorithmically control one or more headborne {LEDs} via a microcontroller. The device can deliver approximately 2 W of power to the {LEDs} in steady state, and 4.3 W in bursts. We also present an optional radio transceiver module (1 g) which, when added to the base headborne device, enables real-time updating of light delivery protocols; dozens of devices can be controlled simultaneously from one computer. We demonstrate use of the technology to wirelessly drive cortical control of movement in mice.

	abstract = {We analyse the limits of the diffusion approximation to the time-independent equation of radiative transfer for homogeneous and heterogeneous biological media. Analytical calculations and finite-difference simulations based on diffusion theory are compared with discrete-ordinate, finite-difference transport calculations. The influence of the ratio of absorption and transport scattering coefficient on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation are quantified and different definitions for the diffusion coefficient, D, are discussed. We also address effects caused by void-like heterogeneities in which absorption and scattering are very small compared with the surrounding medium. Based on results for simple homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, we analyse diffusion and transport calculation of light propagation in the human brain. For these simulations we convert density maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) to optical-parameter maps ( and ) of the brain. We show that diffusion theory fails to describe accurately light propagation in highly absorbing regions, such as haematoma, and void-like spaces, such as the ventricles and the subarachnoid space.},

To date, no studies have explored the neural correlates associated with increases in cognitive load whilst performing a motor task in patients with freezing. In this experiment, 14 {PD} patients with and 15 {PD} patients without freezing of gait underwent 3T {fMRI} while performing a virtual reality gait task. Directions to walk and stop were presented on the viewing screen as either direct cues or as more cognitively indirect pre-learned cues. Both groups showed a consistent pattern of {BOLD} response within the Cognitive Control Network during performance of the paradigm. However, a between group comparison revealed that those {PD} patients with freezing of gait were less able to recruit the bilateral anterior insula, ventral striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area, as well as the left subthalamic nucleus when responding to indirect cognitive cues whilst maintaining a motor output. These results suggest that {PD} patients with freezing of gait are unable to properly recruit specific cortical and subcortical regions within the Cognitive Control Network during the performance of simultaneous motor and cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {While modulating neural activity through stimulation is an effective treatment for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, an opportunity for improving neuromodulation therapy remains in automatically adjusting therapy to continuously optimize patient outcomes. Practical issues associated with achieving this include the paucity of human data related to disease states, poorly validated estimators of patient state, and unknown dynamic mappings of optimal stimulation parameters based on estimated states. To overcome these challenges, we present an investigational platform including: an implanted sensing and stimulation device to collect data and run automated closed-loop algorithms; an external tool to prototype classifier and control-policy algorithms; and real-time telemetry to update the implanted device firmware and monitor its state. The prototyping system was demonstrated in a chronic large animal model studying hippocampal dynamics. We used the platform to find biomarkers of the observed states and transfer functions of different stimulation amplitudes. Data showed that moderate levels of stimulation suppress hippocampal beta activity, while high levels of stimulation produce seizure-like after-discharge activity. The biomarker and transfer function observations were mapped into classifier and control-policy algorithms, which were downloaded to the implanted device to continuously titrate stimulation amplitude for the desired network effect. The platform is designed to be a flexible prototyping tool and could be used to develop improved mechanistic models and automated closed-loop systems for a variety of neurological disorders.},

The major problem in developing an {aDBS} system is choosing the ideal control variable for feedback. Here we review current evidence on the advantages of neurosignal-controlled {aDBS} that uses local field potentials ({LFPs}) as a control variable, and describe the technology already available to create new {aDBS} systems, and the potential benefits of {aDBS} for patients with Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {Inductive power transmission is widely used to energize implantable microelectronic devices ({IMDs}), recharge batteries, and energy harvesters. Power transfer efficiency ({PTE}) and power delivered to the load ({PDL}) are two key parameters in wireless links, which affect the energy source specifications, heat dissipation, power transmission range, and interference with other devices. To improve the {PTE}, a 4-coil inductive link has been recently proposed. Through a comprehensive circuit based analysis that can guide a design and optimization scheme, we have shown that despite achieving high {PTE} at larger coil separations, the 4-coil inductive links fail to achieve a high {PDL}. Instead, we have proposed a 3-coil inductive power transfer link with comparable {PTE} over its 4-coil counterpart at large coupling distances, which can also achieve high {PDL}. We have also devised an iterative design methodology that provides the optimal coil geometries in a 3-coil inductive power transfer link. Design examples of 2-, 3-, and 4-coil inductive links have been presented, and optimized for 13.56 {MHz} carrier frequency and 12 cm coupling distance, showing {PTEs} of 15\%, 37\%, and 35\%, respectively. At this distance, the {PDL} of the proposed 3-coil inductive link is 1.5 and 59 times higher than its equivalent 2- and 4-coil links, respectively. For short coupling distances, however, 2-coil links remain the optimal choice when a high {PDL} is required, while 4-coil links are preferred when the driver has large output resistance or small power is needed. These results have been verified through simulations and measurements.},

Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential ({LFP}) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with {NeuroRighter}, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

We explored the feasibility of recording electrically evoked compound action potentials ({ECAPs}) during {DBS} for use as a feedback control signal. A novel instrumentation system was developed to suppress the stimulus artifact and amplify the small magnitude, short latency {ECAP} response during {DBS} with clinically relevant parameters. In vitro testing demonstrated the capabilities to increase the gain by a factor of 1,000x over a conventional amplifier without saturation, reduce distortion of mock {ECAP} signals, and make high fidelity recordings of mock {ECAPs} at latencies of only 0.5 ms following {DBS} pulses of 50 to 100 μs duration. Subsequently, the instrumentation was used to make in vivo recordings of {ECAPs} during thalamic {DBS} in cats, without contamination by the stimulus artifact. The signal characteristics were similar across three experiments, suggesting common neural activation patterns. The {ECAP} recordings enabled with this novel instrumentation may provide insight into the type and spatial extent of neural elements activated during {DBS}, and could serve as feedback control signals for closed-loop systems.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) is an effective therapy to treat movement disorders including essential tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Despite over a decade of clinical experience the mechanisms of {DBS} are still unclear, and this lack of understanding makes the selection of stimulation parameters quite challenging. The objective of this work was to develop a closed-loop control system that automatically adjusted the stimulation amplitude to reduce oscillatory neuronal activity, based on feedback of electrical signals recorded from the brain using the same electrode as implanted for stimulation. We simulated a population of 100 intrinsically active model neurons in the Vim thalamus, and the local field potentials ({LFPs}) generated by the population were used as the feedback (control) variable for closed loop control of {DBS} amplitude. Based on the correlation between the spectral content of the thalamic activity and tremor (Hua , 1998), (Lenz , 1988), we implemented an adaptive minimum variance controller to regulate the power spectrum of the simulated {LFPs} and restore the {LFP} power spectrum present under tremor conditions to a reference profile derived under tremor free conditions. The controller was based on a recursively identified autoregressive model ({ARX}) of the relationship between stimulation input and {LFP} output, and showed excellent performances in tracking the reference spectral features through selective changes in the theta (2-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-35 Hz) frequency ranges. Such changes reflected modifications in the firing patterns of the model neuronal population, and, differently from open-loop {DBS}, replaced the tremor-related pathological patterns with patterns similar to those simulated in tremor-free conditions. The closed-loop controller generated a {LFP} spectrum that approximated more closely the spectrum present in the tremor-free condition than did open loop fixed intensity stimulation and adapted to match the spectrum afte- - r a change in the neuronal oscillation frequency. This computational study suggests the feasibility of closed-loop control of {DBS} amplitude to regulate the spectrum of the local field potentials and thereby normalize the aberrant pattern of neuronal activity present in tremor.},

Current methodologies are based on decoding the motor intent from the recorded neural activity and transforming the extracted information into motor commands to control external devices as robotic arms. We developed a novel computational approach, based on the concept of programming dynamical behaviors trough the bi-directional sensory-motor interaction between the brain and the connected external device. This approach is based on the emulation of some control features of a biological interface, the spinal cord. The first prototype of our interface controls the state of motion of a simulated point mass in a viscous medium. The position of the point mass is encoded into a stimulus to the somatosensory cortex of an anesthetized rat. The evoked activity of a population of motor cortical neurons is decoded into a force vector applied to the point mass. The parameters of the encoder and of the decoder are set to approximate a desired force field. In the first test of the interface, we obtained a family of trajectories that converged upon a stable attractor.},

This synchrony preferentially occurs over 10–30 Hz, the so-called beta band. Correlative evidence has been supplemented by experiments in which direct stimulation of the basal ganglia in the beta band slows movement. Yet questions remain regarding the small scale of the latter effects and whether synchrony is an early or even obligatory feature of parkinsonism. Nevertheless, the principle that abnormally synchronised activity in the beta band can disrupt the function finds a precedent in the syndrome of cortical myoclonus. Here, pathologically synchronised discharges of pyramidal neurons are transmitted to the healthy spinal cord. The result is the synchronous discharge of motor units leading to rhythmic jerking.},

In patients with bilateral tremor of extrapyramidal origin, who were resistant to drug therapy, the therapeutic protocol associated (1) a radiofrequency {VIM} thalamotomy for the most disabled side, and (2) a continuous {VIM} stimulation for the other side using stereotactically implanted electrodes, connected to subcutaneous stimulators. {VIM} thalamotomy relieved the tremor in all operated cases. Side effects were mild and regressive. {VIM} stimulation strongly decreased the tremor but failed to suppress it as completely as thalamotomy did. This was due in part to the fact that programmable stimulator frequency rate is limited to 130 Hz, while it appeared that the optimal stimulation frequency was 200 Hz.

Reducing the size of the monitoring and stimulating electrodes by orders of magnitude (to the size of neural elements) allows remarkable improvements in both monitoring (spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and sensitivity) and stimulation. Carbon nanofiber nanoelectrode technology offers the possibility of trimodal arrays (monitoring electrical activity, monitoring neurotransmitter levels, precise stimulation). {DBS} can then be guided by changes in brain electrical activity and/or neurotransmitter levels (i.e. closed-loop {DBS}). Here, we describe the basic manufacture and electrical characteristics of a prototype nanoelectrode array for {DBS}, as well as preliminary studies with electroconductive polymers necessary to optimize {DBS} in vivo. An approach such as the nanoelectrode array described here may offer a generic electrical-neural interface for use in various neural prostheses.},

Various design candidates created in adaptable design are evaluated by different life-cycle evaluation measures including product adaptability of design, part and assembly costs of manufacturing, and operationability of customers. Since different evaluation measures are modeled in different units, the grey relational analysis method is employed to integrate these measures for prioritizing different design candidates.

	shorttitle = {Complications of Deep Brain Stimulation},
	abstract = {Background 
Since the first deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) performed for movement disorder more than a decade ago, {DBS} has become a standard operation for advanced Parkinson's disease. Its indications are expanding to areas of dystonia, psychiatric conditions and refractory epilepsy. Additionally, a new set of {DBS}-related complications have arisen. Many teams found a slow learning curve from this complication-prone operation. We would like to investigate complications arising from 100 {DBS} electrode insertions and its prevention. 
Methods 
We performed an audit in all {DBS} patients for operation-related complications in our centre from 1997 to 2008. Complications were classified into operation-related, hardware-related and stimulation-related. Operation-related complications included intracranial haemorrhages and electrode malposition. Hardware-related complications included fracture of electrodes, electrode migration, infection and erosion. Stimulation-related complications included sensorimotor conditions, psychiatric conditions and life-threatening conditions. 
Results 
From 1997 to the end of 2008, 100 {DBS} electrodes were inserted in 55 patients for movement disorders, mostly for Parkinson's disease (50 patients). There was one symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage (1\%) and two electrode malpositions (2\%). Meticulous surgical planning, use of microdriver and a reliable electrode anchorage device would minimise this group of complications. There were two electrode fractures, one electrode migration and one pulse-generator infection which contributed to the hardware-related complication rate of 5\%. There was no sensorimotor or life-threatening complications in our group. However, three patients suffered from reversible psychiatric symptoms after {DBS}. 
Conclusion 
{DBS} is, on the one hand, an effective surgical treatment for movement disorders. On the other hand, it is a complication-prone operation. A dedicated “Movement Disorder Team” consisting of neurologists, neurophysiologists, functional neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists and nursing specialists is essential. Liaison among team members in perioperative periods and postoperative care is the key to avoiding complications and having a successful patient outcome.},

	abstract = {Neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation; {DBS}) has become an established treatment for movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), and is in trials for refractory epilepsy, headache, and certain mood disorders. Two main themes will advance {DBS} significantly in the next five years: closed-loop {DBS}, that is, feedback from brain electrical activity to direct the stimulation; and computational analysis ({CA})—electrophysiological modeling to enhance {DBS}. Closed-loop {DBS} is currently in clinical trials for refractory epilepsy. New imaging techniques offer preoperative modeling for {DBS} surgery, including nerve fiber tracts (diffusion tensor imaging), and imaging of volume of tissue activated by a specific electrode. {CA} techniques for {DBS} include mathematical models of the abnormally synchronized electrical activity which underlies epilepsy, movement disorders, and likely many mood disorders as well. By incorporating feedback loops and multiple recording and/or stimulating sites, the abnormally synchronized brain electrical activity can be desynchronized, then “unlearned” (“unkindling” in epilepsy). Characteristics of {DBS} utilizing {CA} include low frequency rather than high frequency stimulation; multiple stimulation and/or recording sites; likely 10-fold or more reduction in electrical current needs (much smaller “pulse generators”); more focused and less disruptive stimulation—fewer unwanted side effects; and potential to “cure” certain disorders by resetting abnormal firing patterns back to normal. These advantages of more sophisticated {DBS} techniques bring the following challenges, which may require a decade of research before reaching clinical practice because many brain disorders involve neurotransmitter abnormalities (e.g., dopamine in Parkinson's disease and certain mood disorders). Namely, how do we monitor and modulate neurotransmitters in addition to electrical activity? How do we get multiple microelectrodes into the brain in a minimally invasive manner? In the accompanying article, I address these two issues and offer some potential solutions.},

Clinical studies in the 1970s and early 1980s have revealed a technique with modest results which did not lead to regulatory approval for the treatment of pain. In the 1980s a new application for {DBS} emerged in the treatment of movement disorders. Clinical trials confirmed the robustness of the therapy leading to approvals by regulatory authorities in the {US} and Europe for the treatment of tremor and the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Technology based on that used for earlier clinical research in pain was improved by leveraging advances in cardiac pacing technology resulting in the sophisticated and reliable systems available today. In the 1990s scientific exploration began in the treatment of psychiatric disorders which is ongoing today. Simultaneously, studies into the treatment of epilepsy were begun which resulted in regulatory approval in Europe. Suggestions have been made to expand these scientific explorations to other central nervous system dysfunctions. Opportunity remains to improve the technology including individualized and symptom specific stimulation patterns, more physician and patient friendly programming, and possibly closed-loop systems for more situation dependent and effective therapy.},

Using this knowledge as a framework, we then explore a specific hypothesis regarding {DBS} of the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) for the treatment of {PD}. This hypothesis states that therapeutic benefit is provided, at least in part, by activation of surviving nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, subsequent striatal dopamine release, and resumption of striatal target cell control by dopamine. While highly controversial, we present preliminary data that are consistent with specific predications testing this hypothesis. We additionally propose that developing new technologies, e.g., human electrometer and closed-loop smart devices, for monitoring dopaminergic neurotransmission during {STN} {DBS} will further advance this treatment approach.},

Continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) is a widely used therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease ({PD}) management.

Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia ({BG}) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into {PD} pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop {DBS} and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop {DBS} paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the {BG}-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced {PD}. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized.},

	abstract = {Chronically implantable, closed-loop neuromodulation devices with concurrent sensing and stimulation hold promise for better understanding the nervous system and improving therapies for neurological disease. Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

Microelectrodes are used to detect and measure cellular spiking activity while macroelectrodes are considered more suitable for measuring the collective sum of slow potentials from multiple cells near the electrode, the local field potential ({LFP}). Precisely how the characteristics of an electrode affect the data recorded is still unclear. Technical idiosyncrasies of some surgical cases allowed serendipitous data collection from a 250 to 6000 Hz bandpassed macroelectrode recording during {DBS} implantation for {PD}. Simultaneous recording from both a microelectrode and macroelectrode were compared along the same surgical trajectory. Audio, normalized root mean square of the recorded signal, and power spectrograms were used to analyze the data. The analyses demonstrate similar results in detecting cellular spiking activity when recording with macroelectrodes compared with microelectrodes.

In particular, oscillations at around 20 Hz, in the so-called beta frequency band, relate to the cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia and rigidity. Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) of the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) can significantly improve these motor impairments. Recent evidence has demonstrated reduction of beta oscillations concurrent with alleviation of {PD} motor symptoms, raising the possibility that suppression of aberrant activity may mediate the effects of {DBS}. Here we review the evidence supporting suppression of pathological oscillations during stimulation and discuss how this might underlie the efficacy of {DBS}. We also consider how beta activity may provide a feedback signal suitable for next generation closed-loop and intelligent stimulators.},

	title = {Recording human electrocorticographic ({ECoG}) signals for neuroscientific research and real-time functional cortical mapping},
	issn = {1940-087X},
	doi = {10.3791/3993},
	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography ({EEG}), magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography ({ECoG}) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than {EEG}, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., {\textless}1 cm/{\textless}1 millisecond, respectively). {ECoG} involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that {ECoG} amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function. {ECoG} can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing ({BCI}) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and control. Nevertheless, human {ECoG} data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human {ECoG} data. We describe our methods for collecting recording {ECoG}, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the {BCI}2000 software platform and the {SIGFRIED} method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation. {PREREQUISITES} {AND} {PLANNING}: Patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on previous {EEG} monitoring, on a structural {MRI} of the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to acquire human {ECoG} data for neuroscientific research. The decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the {ECoG} electrodes are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.{USBamp} amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are safety-rated and {FDA}-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are found, and they come with an {SDK} that allows them to be integrated with custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than that of the typical {EEG} experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our {BCI}2000 software. {BCI}2000 is a freely available general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in C++, {MATLAB} or Python. {BCI}2000 consists of four modules that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant {ECoG} features and translates them into output signals; an Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our experimentation using the {SIGFRIED} ({SIGnal} modeling For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical stimulation ({ECS}). Although {ECS} mapping remains the gold standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of {ECS} mapping is time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and refined by {ECS}. The results from our passive {SIGFRIED} mapping technique have been shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using {ECS} mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology for gathering human {ECoG} data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using the {BCI}2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the {BCI}2000-based {SIGFRIED} system.},

It does not automatically adapt to the instantaneous patient's needs or to the progression of the disease. This paper demonstrates an adaptive closed-loop controlled {DBS} that, after switching off stimulation, tracks few physiological signals to predict the reappearance of tremor before the patient experiences discomfort, at which point it instructs the {DBS} controller to switch on stimulation again. The core of the proposed approach is a Neural Network ({NN}) which effectively extracts tremor predictive information from non-invasively recorded surface-electromyogram({sEMG}) and accelerometer signals measured at the symptomatic extremities. A simple feed-forward back-propagation {NN} architecture is shown to successfully predict tremor in 31 out of 33 trials in two Parkinson's Disease patients with an overall accuracy of 75.8\% and sensitivity of 92.3\%. This work therefore shows that closed-loop {DBS} control is feasible in the near future and that it can be achieved without modifications of the electrodes implanted in the brain, i.e., is backward compatible with approved {DBS} systems.},

	abstract = {Seizure control using deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) provides an alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant epilepsy. This paper presents novel {DBS} stimulus protocols to disrupt seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured firing rates to adjust stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris–Lecar (M–L) model neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using second order network topology ({SONET}) to simulate network topologies measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate {DBS}. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the firing rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli slightly slower than the firing rate prevent synchronization. We present an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the firing rate of a neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus frequency to firing frequency and demonstrate it in a computational model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than the open-loop control.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor signs affecting gait, postural stability, and tremor. These symptoms can be improved when electrodes are implanted in deep brain structures and electrical stimulation is delivered chronically at high frequency ({\textgreater}100 Hz). Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) onset or cessation affects {PD} signs with different latencies, and the long-term improvements of symptoms affecting the body axis and those affecting the limbs vary in duration. Interestingly, these effects have not been systematically analyzed and modeled. We compare these timing phenomena in relation to one axial (i.e., locomotion) and one distal (i.e., tremor) signs. We suggest that during {DBS}, these symptoms are improved by different network mechanisms operating at multiple time scales. Locomotion improvement may involve a delayed plastic reorganization, which takes hours to develop, whereas rest tremor is probably alleviated by an almost instantaneous desynchronization of neural activity in subcortical structures. Even if all {PD} patients develop both distal and axial symptoms sooner or later, current computational models of locomotion and rest tremor are separate. Furthermore, a few computational models of locomotion focus on {PD} and none exploring the effect of {DBS} was found in the literature. We, therefore, discuss a model of a neuronal network during {DBS}, general enough to explore the subcircuits controlling locomotion and rest tremor simultaneously. This model accounts for synchronization and plasticity, two mechanisms that are believed to underlie the two types of symptoms analyzed. We suggest that a hysteretic effect caused by {DBS}-induced plasticity and synchronization modulation contributes to the different therapeutic latencies observed. Such a comprehensive, generic computational model of {DBS} effects, incorporating these timing phenomena, should assist in developing a more efficient, faster, durable treatment of distal and axial signs in {PD}.},

	abstract = {Objective. To explore the use of classical feedback control methods to achieve an improved deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) algorithm for application to Parkinson's disease ({PD}). Approach. A computational model of {PD} dynamics was employed to develop model-based rational feedback controller design. The restoration of thalamocortical relay capabilities to patients suffering from {PD} is formulated as a feedback control problem with the {DBS} waveform serving as the control input. Two high-level control strategies are tested: one that is driven by an online estimate of thalamic reliability, and another that acts to eliminate substantial decreases in the inhibition from the globus pallidus interna ({GPi}) to the thalamus. Control laws inspired by traditional proportional-integral-derivative ({PID}) methodology are prescribed for each strategy and simulated on this computational model of the basal ganglia network. Main Results. For control based upon thalamic reliability, a strategy of frequency proportional control with proportional bias delivered the optimal control achieved for a given energy expenditure. In comparison, control based upon synaptic inhibitory output from the {GPi} performed very well in comparison with those of reliability-based control, with considerable further reduction in energy expenditure relative to that of open-loop {DBS}. The best controller performance was amplitude proportional with derivative control and integral bias, which is full {PID} control. We demonstrated how optimizing the three components of {PID} control is feasible in this setting, although the complexity of these optimization functions argues for adaptive methods in implementation. Significance. Our findings point to the potential value of model-based rational design of feedback controllers for Parkinson's disease.},

In this study, a new model of the closed loop network is used to explore the generation and interaction of network oscillations and their suppression through deep brain stimulation ({DBS}). Under simulated dopamine depletion conditions, increased gain through the hyperdirect pathway resulted in the interaction of neural oscillations at different frequencies in the cortex and subthalamic nucleus ({STN}), leading to the emergence of synchronized oscillations at a new intermediate frequency. Further increases in synaptic gain resulted in the cortex driving synchronous oscillatory activity throughout the network. When {DBS} was added to the model a progressive reduction in {STN} power at the tremor and beta frequencies was observed as the frequency of stimulation was increased, with resonance effects occurring for low frequency {DBS} (\${\textless}\$40 Hz) in agreement with experimental observations. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronous oscillations can arise within the network and how {DBS} may suppress unwanted oscillatory activity.},

This creeping fluid flow has been shown to affect the morphology and migration of cells such as fibroblasts, cancer cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. A microfluidic cell culture system was designed to apply stable pressure gradients and fluid flow and allow direct visualization of transient responses of cells seeded in a 3D collagen type I scaffold. We used this system to examine the effects of interstitial flow on cancer cell morphology and migration and to extend previous studies showing that interstitial flow increases the metastatic potential of {MDA}-{MB}-435S melanoma cells [Shields J, et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 11:526–538]. Using a breast carcinoma line ({MDA}-{MB}-231) we also observed cell migration along streamlines in the presence of flow; however, we further demonstrated that the strength of the flow as well as the cell density determined directional bias of migration along the streamline. In particular, we found that cells either at high seeding density or with the {CCR}-7 receptor inhibited migration against, rather than with the flow. We provide further evidence that {CCR}7-dependent autologous chemotaxis is the mechanism that leads to migration with the flow, but also demonstrate a competing {CCR}7-independent mechanism that causes migration against the flow. Data from experiments investigating the effects of cell concentration, interstitial flow rate, receptor activity, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation support our hypothesis that the competing stimulus is integrin mediated. This mechanism may play an important role in development of metastatic disease.},

In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using {BCIs} is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether {BCIs} use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance {BCI} than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or {\textasciitilde}15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of {BCIs} in humans.},

	abstract = {A scientific study of consciousness should take into consideration both objective and subjective measures of conscious experiences. To this date, very few studies have tried to integrate third-person data, or data about the neurophysiological correlates of conscious states, with first-person data, or data about subjective experience. Inspired by Morel's invention (Casares, 1940), a literary machine capable of reproducing sensory-dependent external reality, this article suggests that combination of virtual reality techniques and brain reading technologies, that is, decoding of conscious states by brain activity alone, can offer this integration. It is also proposed that the multimodal, simulating, and integrative capacities of the dreaming brain render it an “endogenous” Morel's machine, which can potentially be used in studying consciousness, but not always in a reliable way. Both the literary machine and dreaming could contribute to a better understanding of conscious states.},

	abstract = {Effective estimation of the salience of environmental stimuli underlies adaptive behavior, while related aberrance is believed to undermine rational thought processes in schizophrenia. A network including bilateral frontoinsular cortex ({FIC}) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({dACC}) has been observed to respond to salient stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). To test the hypothesis that activity in this salience network ({SN}) is less discriminately modulated by contextually-relevant stimuli in schizophrenia than in healthy individuals, {fMRI} data were collected in 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 13 matched controls during performance of a modified monetary incentive delay ({MID}) task. After quantitatively identifying spatial components representative of the {FIC} and {dACC} features of the {SN}, two principal analyses were conducted. In the first, modulation of {SN} activity by salience was assessed by measuring response to trial outcome. First-level general linear models were applied to individual-specific time-courses of {SN} activity identified using spatial independent component analysis ({ICA}). This analysis revealed a significant salience-by-performance-by-group interaction on the best-fit {FIC} component's activity at trial outcome, whereby healthy individuals but not individuals with schizophrenia exhibited greater distinction between the response to hits and misses in high salience trials than in low salience trials. The second analysis aimed to ascertain whether {SN} component amplitude differed between the study groups over the duration of the experiment. Independent-samples T-tests on back-projected, percent-signal-change scaled {SN} component images importantly showed that the groups did not differ in the overall amplitude of {SN} expression over the entire dataset. These findings of dysregulated but not decreased {SN} activity in schizophrenia provide physiological support for mechanistic conceptual frameworks of delusional thought formation.},

	abstract = {Genetically encoded calcium indicators ({GECIs}) are powerful tools for systems neuroscience. Here we describe red, single-wavelength {GECIs}, “{RCaMPs},” engineered from circular permutation of the thermostable red fluorescent protein {mRuby}. High-resolution crystal structures of {mRuby}, the red sensor {RCaMP}, and the recently published red {GECI} R-{GECO}1 give insight into the chromophore environments of the Ca2+-bound state of the sensors and the engineered protein domain interfaces of the different indicators. We characterized the biophysical properties and performance of {RCaMP} sensors in vitro and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila larvae, and larval zebrafish. Further, we demonstrate 2-color calcium imaging both within the same cell (registering mitochondrial and somatic [Ca2+]) and between two populations of cells: neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we perform integrated optogenetics experiments, wherein neural activation via channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) or a red-shifted variant, and activity imaging via {RCaMP} or {GCaMP}, are conducted simultaneously, with the {ChR}2/{RCaMP} pair providing independently addressable spectral channels. Using this paradigm, we measure calcium responses of naturalistic and {ChR}2-evoked muscle contractions in vivo in crawling C. elegans. We systematically compare the {RCaMP} sensors to R-{GECO}1, in terms of action potential-evoked fluorescence increases in neurons, photobleaching, and photoswitching. R-{GECO}1 displays higher Ca2+ affinity and larger dynamic range than {RCaMP}, but exhibits significant photoactivation with blue and green light, suggesting that integrated channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics using R-{GECO}1 may be subject to artifact. Finally, we create and test blue, cyan, and yellow variants engineered from {GCaMP} by rational design. This engineered set of chromatic variants facilitates new experiments in functional imaging and optogenetics.},

We found that {MChR}1 has the most red-shifted and {pH}-independent spectral sensitivity so far reported, matches or surpasses known channelrhodopsins’ channel kinetics features, and undergoes minimal inactivation upon sustained illumination.

	abstract = {Microbial-type rhodopsins are found in archaea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Some of them represent membrane ion transport proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump, or channelrhodopsin-1 ({ChR}1), a recently identified light-gated proton channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. {ChR}1 and {ChR}2, a related microbial-type rhodopsin from C. reinhardtii, were shown to be involved in generation of photocurrents of this green alga. We demonstrate by functional expression, both in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells, that {ChR}2 is a directly light-switched cation-selective ion channel. This channel opens rapidly after absorption of a photon to generate a large permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. {ChR}2 desensitizes in continuous light to a smaller steady-state conductance. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H+ and negative membrane potential, whereas closing of the {ChR}2 ion channel is decelerated by intracellular H+. {ChR}2 is expressed mainly in C. reinhardtii under low-light conditions, suggesting involvement in photoreception in dark-adapted cells. The predicted seven-transmembrane α helices of {ChR}2 are characteristic for G protein-coupled receptors but reflect a different motif for a cation-selective ion channel. Finally, we demonstrate that {ChR}2 may be used to depolarize small or large cells, simply by illumination.},

	shorttitle = {Evolution of the archaeal rhodopsins},
	abstract = {The amino acid sequences of 25 archaeal retinal proteins from 13 different strains of extreme halophiles were analyzed to establish their molecular phylogenetic relationship. On the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, these proteins apparently formed a distinct family designated as the archaeal rhodopsin family ({ARF}), which was not related to other known proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors. The archaeal rhodopsin family was further divided into four clusters with different functions; H+ pump (bacteriorhodopsin), Cl− pump (halorhodopsin), and two kinds of sensor (sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin). These four rhodopsin clusters seemed to have occurred by gene duplication(s) before the generic speciation of halophilic archaea, based on phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, the degrees of differences in amino acid sequences within each cluster simply reflected the divergent evolution of halophilic archaea. By comparing the branch lengths after speciation points of the reconstituted tree, we calculated the relative evolution rates of the four archaeal rhodopsins bacteriorhodopsin:halorhodopsin:sensory rhodopsin: phoborhodopsin to be 5:4:3:10. From these values, the degrees of functional and structural restriction of each protein can be inferred. The branching topology of four clusters grouped bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin versus sensory rhodopsin and phoborhodopsin by likelihood mapping. Using bacteriorhodopsin (and halorhodopsin) as an outgroup, the gene duplication point of sensory rhodopsin/phoborhodopsin was determined. By calculating the branch lengths between the gene duplication point and each halophilic archaea speciation point, we could speculate upon the relative evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin and pre-phoborhodopsin. The evolution rate of pre-sensory rhodopsin was fivefold faster than that of pre-phoborhodopsin, which suggests that the original function of the ancestral sensor was similar to that of phoborhodopsin, and that sensory rhodopsin evolved from pre-sensory rhodopsin by the accumulation of mutations. The changes in evolution rate by gene duplication and functional differentiation were demonstrated in the archaeal rhodopsin family using the gene duplication date and halobacterial speciation date as common time stamps.},

With 33.7\% salinity, it is also one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Assal (Djibouti), Garabogazköl and some hypersaline lakes of the {McMurdo} Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond) have reported higher salinities. It is 8.6 times saltier than the ocean.[5] This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which animals cannot flourish, hence its name.

	abstract = {The neural circuits underlying emotional valence and motivated behaviors are several synapses away from both defined sensory inputs and quantifiable motor outputs. Electrophysiology has provided us with a suitable means for observing neural activity during behavior, but methods for controlling activity for the purpose of studying motivated behaviors have been inadequate: electrical stimulation lacks cellular specificity and pharmacological manipulation lacks temporal resolution. The recent emergence of optogenetic tools provides a new means for establishing causal relationships between neural activity and behavior. Optogenetics, the use of genetically-encodable light-activated proteins, permits the modulation of specific neural circuit elements with millisecond precision. The ability to control individual cell types, and even projections between distal regions, allows us to investigate functional connectivity in a causal manner. The greatest consequence of controlling neural activity with finer precision has been the characterization of individual neural circuits within anatomical brain regions as defined functional units. Within the mesolimbic dopamine system, optogenetics has helped separate subsets of dopamine neurons with distinct functions for reward, aversion and salience processing, elucidated {GABA} neuronal effects on behavior, and characterized connectivity with forebrain and cortical structures. Within the striatum, optogenetics has confirmed the opposing relationship between direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons ({MSNs}), in addition to characterizing the inhibition of {MSNs} by cholinergic interneurons. Within the hypothalamus, optogenetics has helped overcome the heterogeneity in neuronal cell-type and revealed distinct circuits mediating aggression and feeding. Within the amygdala, optogenetics has allowed the study of intra-amygdala microcircuitry as well as interconnections with distal regions involved in fear and anxiety. In this review, we will present the body of optogenetic studies that has significantly enhanced our understanding of emotional valence and motivated behaviors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled “Optogenetics”.},

	abstract = {The ability to stimulate mammalian cells with light has significantly changed our understanding of electrically excitable tissues in health and disease, paving the way toward various novel therapeutic applications. Here, we demonstrate the potential of optogenetic control in cardiac cells using a hybrid experimental/computational technique. Experimentally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells via a lentiviral vector, and sorted and expanded the genetically engineered cells. Via directed differentiation, we created channelrhodopsin-expressing cardiomyocytes, which we subjected to optical stimulation. To quantify the impact of photostimulation, we assessed electrical, biochemical, and mechanical signals using patch-clamping, multielectrode array recordings, and video microscopy. Computationally, we introduced channelrhodopsin-2 into a classic autorhythmic cardiac cell model via an additional photocurrent governed by a light-sensitive gating variable. Upon optical stimulation, the channel opens and allows sodium ions to enter the cell, inducing a fast upstroke of the transmembrane potential. We calibrated the channelrhodopsin-expressing cell model using single action potential readings for different photostimulation amplitudes, pulse widths, and frequencies. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, we virtually injected channelrhodopsin-expressing cells into different locations of a human heart, and explored its activation sequences upon optical stimulation. Our experimentally calibrated computational toolbox allows us to virtually probe landscapes of process parameters, and identify optimal photostimulation sequences toward pacing hearts with light.},

We review the most well known algorithms for constructing networks with given non-homogeneous statistical properties and provide simple pseudo-code for reproducing such networks in software simulations. We also review some useful mathematical results and approximations associated with the statistics that describe these network models, including degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient. We demonstrate how such results can be used as partial verification and validation of implementations. Finally, we discuss a sometimes overlooked modeling choice that can be crucially important for the properties of simulated networks: that of network directedness. The most well known network algorithms produce undirected networks, and we emphasize this point by highlighting how simple adaptations can instead produce directed networks.},

	abstract = {Neuronal network models often assume a fixed probability of connection between neurons. This assumption leads to random networks with binomial in-degree and out-degree distributions which are relatively narrow. Here I study the effect of broad degree distributions on network dynamics by interpolating between a binomial and a truncated power-law distribution for the in-degree and out-degree independently. This is done both for an inhibitory network (I network) as well as for the recurrent excitatory connections in a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons ({EI} network). In both cases increasing the width of the in-degree distribution affects the global state of the network by driving transitions between asynchronous behavior and oscillations. This effect is reproduced in a simplified rate model which includes the heterogeneity in neuronal input due to the in-degree of cells. On the other hand, broadening the out-degree distribution is shown to increase the fraction of common inputs to pairs of neurons. This leads to increases in the amplitude of the cross-correlation ({CC}) of synaptic currents. In the case of the I network, despite strong oscillatory {CCs} in the currents, {CCs} of the membrane potential are low due to filtering and reset effects, leading to very weak {CCs} of the spike-count. In the asynchronous regime of the {EI} network, broadening the out-degree increases the amplitude of {CCs} in the recurrent excitatory currents, while {CC} of the total current is essentially unaffected as are pairwise spiking correlations. This is due to a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. In the oscillatory regime, changes in the out-degree can have a large effect on spiking correlations and even on the qualitative dynamical state of the network.},

Previous modeling works have incorporated representations of some or all of these mechanisms. In this study, we consider a single-compartment model of a pre-{BötC} inspiratory neuron that encompasses particular aspects of all of these features. We present a novel mathematical analysis of the interaction of the corresponding rhythmic mechanisms arising in the model, including square-wave bursting and autonomous calcium oscillations, which requires treatment of a system of differential equations incorporating three slow variables.},

	abstract = {Motivated by experiments employing optogenetic stimulation of cortical regions, we consider spike control strategies for ensembles of uncoupled integrate and fire neurons with a common conductance input. We construct strategies for control of spike patterns, that is, multineuron trains of action potentials, up to some maximal spike rate determined by the neural biophysics. We emphasize a constructive role for parameter heterogeneity, and find a simple rule for controllability in pairs of neurons. In particular, we determine parameters for which common drive is not limited to inducing synchronous spiking. For large ensembles, we determine how the number of controllable neurons varies with the number of observed (recorded) neurons, and what collateral spiking occurs in the full ensemble during control of the subensemble. While complete control of spiking in every neuron is not possible with a single input, we find that a degree of subensemble control is made possible by exploiting dynamical heterogeneity. As most available technologies for neural stimulation are underactuated, in the sense that the number of target neurons far exceeds the number of independent channels of stimulation, these results suggest partial control strategies that may be important in the development of sensory neuroprosthetics and other neurocontrol applications.},

	abstract = {Object
In single patients with a cerebral aneurysm an external ventricular drain ({EVD}), an intracranial pressure ({ICP}) gauge or a combined {EVD} and {ICP} gauge placement is necessary after coil embolization and initiation of postprocedural anticoagulation. The aim of this study was to examine the hemorrhage rates of drain placement within 48h after aneurysm coiling and under anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed hemorrhage rates of {EVD}, {ICP} gauge or combined {EVD} and {ICP} gauge placement in 27 patients within 48h after coil embolization under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet schemes (heparin, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel). In patients with continuous heparin via perfusor the application was stopped periprocedurally. The results were compared to literature.
Results
Four hemorrhages (14.8\%) were observed. Three hemorrhages were petechial and one was by definition a larger hemorrhage with 8mm×10mm in diameter.
Conclusions
{EVD}, {ICP} gauge or combined {EVD} and {ICP} gauge placements within 48h after cerebral aneurysm coiling and under different anticoagulation or antiplatelet regimens seem to have no increased risk of hemorrhages compared to literature.},

Technologies that enable temporally precise control of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons’ neighbors — whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of nanometers away — must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control. Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic tools, such as thermosensitive {TRP} channels, can be used to drive neural activity downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement of these toolboxes.},

However, an optical fiber is limited to delivering light to a single target within the three-dimensional structure of the brain. We here demonstrate a multiwaveguide probe capable of independently delivering light to multiple targets along the probe axis, thus enabling versatile optical control of sets of distributed brain targets. The 1.45-cm-long probe is microfabricated in the form of a 360-μm-wide array of 12 parallel silicon oxynitride ({SiON}) multimode waveguides clad with {SiO}2 and coated with aluminum; probes of custom dimensions are easily created as well. The waveguide array accepts light from a set of sources at the input end and guides the light down each waveguide to an aluminum corner mirror that efficiently deflects light away from the probe axis. Light losses at each stage are small (input coupling loss, 0.4±0.3dB; bend loss, negligible; propagation loss, 3.1±1dB/cm using the outscattering method and 3.2±0.4dB/cm using the cutback method; corner mirror loss, 1.5±0.4dB); a waveguide coupled, for example, to a 5mW source will deliver over 1.5mW to a target at a depth of 1cm.},

An ideal therapy would permit correction of activity just in specific target neurons, while leaving other neurons unaltered. Recently our lab revealed that the naturally-occurring light-activated proteins channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2) and halorhodopsin (Halo/{NpHR}) can, when genetically expressed in neurons, enable them to be safely, precisely, and reversibly activated and silenced by pulses of blue and yellow light, respectively. We here describe the ability to make specific neurons in the brain light-sensitive, using a viral approach. We also reveal the design and construction of a scalable, fully-implantable optical prosthetic capable of delivering light of appropriate intensity and wavelength to targeted neurons at arbitrary 3-D locations within the brain, enabling activation and silencing of specific neuron types at multiple locations. Finally, we demonstrate control of neural activity in the cortex of the non-human primate, a key step in the translation of such technology for human clinical use. Systems for optical targeting of specific neural circuit elements may enable a new generation of high-precision therapies for brain disorders.},

	abstract = {The quest to determine how precise neural activity patterns mediate computation, behavior, and pathology would be greatly aided by a set of tools for reliably activating and inactivating genetically targeted neurons, in a temporally precise and rapidly reversible fashion. Having earlier adapted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2), for allowing neurons to be stimulated by blue light, we searched for a complementary tool that would enable optical neuronal inhibition, driven by light of a second color. Here we report that targeting the codon-optimized form of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from the archaebacterium Natronomas pharaonis (hereafter abbreviated Halo) to genetically-specified neurons enables them to be silenced reliably, and reversibly, by millisecond-timescale pulses of yellow light. We show that trains of yellow and blue light pulses can drive high-fidelity sequences of hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in neurons simultaneously expressing yellow light-driven Halo and blue light-driven {ChR}2, allowing for the first time manipulations of neural synchrony without perturbation of other parameters such as spiking rates. The Halo/{ChR}2 system thus constitutes a powerful toolbox for multichannel photoinhibition and photostimulation of virally or transgenically targeted neural circuits without need for exogenous chemicals, enabling systematic analysis and engineering of the brain, and quantitative bioengineering of excitable cells.},

Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain {TP}009, which we named {ArchT}, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (∼900 {pA} in vitro), but with a {\textgreater}3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, most notably in the optogenetic range of 1–10 {mW}/mm2, equating to {\textgreater}2× increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber. Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, {ArchT} expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore {ArchT} use in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of {ArchT}-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (∼100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/s upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following the onset of light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that {ArchT} silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

Optogenetics is currently the state-of-the-art method for causal-oriented brain research. Despite an increasingly large number of invertebrate and rodent studies showing profound electrophysiological and behavioral effects induced by optogenetics [1, 2], only two primate studies have reported modulation of local single-cell activity but with no behavioral effects [3, 4]. Here, we show that optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons within rhesus monkey arcuate sulcus, during the execution of a visually guided saccade task, evoked significant and reproducible changes in saccade latencies as a function of target position. Moreover, using concurrent optogenetic stimulation and opto-{fMRI} [5, 6]), we observed optogenetically induced changes in {fMRI} activity in specific functional cortical networks throughout the monkey brain. This is critical information for the advancement of optogenetic primate research models and for initiating the development of optogenetically based cell-specific therapies with which to treat neurological diseases in humans.},

Compared with previous works using voxel-based media discretization, a mesh-based approach can be more accurate in modeling targets with curved boundaries or locally refined structures. We implement an efficient ray-tracing technique using Plücker Coordinates. The Barycentric coordinates computed from Plücker-formed ray-tracing enables us to use linear Lagrange basis functions to model both media properties and fluence distribution, leading to further improvement in accuracy. The Plücker-coordinate ray-polygon intersection test can be extended to hexahedral or high-order elements. Excellent agreement is found when comparing mesh-based {MC} with the analytical diffusion model and 3D voxel-based {MC} code in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. Realistic time-resolved imaging results are observed for a complex human brain anatomy using mesh-based {MC}. We also include multi-threading support in the software and will port it to a graphics processing unit platform in the near future.},

	abstract = {Previous work has reported that it is not difficult to give people the illusion of ownership over an artificial body, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying body perception and self consciousness. We present an experimental study that uses immersive virtual reality ({IVR}) focused on identifying the perceptual building blocks of this illusion. We systematically manipulated visuotactile and visual sensorimotor contingencies, visual perspective, and the appearance of the virtual body in order to assess their relative role and mutual interaction. Consistent results from subjective reports and physiological measures showed that a first person perspective over a fake humanoid body is essential for eliciting a body ownership illusion. We found that the illusion of ownership can be generated when the virtual body has a realistic skin tone and spatially substitutes the real body seen from a first person perspective. In this case there is no need for an additional contribution of congruent visuotactile or sensorimotor cues. Additionally, we found that the processing of incongruent perceptual cues can be modulated by the level of the illusion: when the illusion is strong, incongruent cues are not experienced as incorrect. Participants exposed to asynchronous visuotactile stimulation can experience the ownership illusion and perceive touch as originating from an object seen to contact the virtual body. Analogously, when the level of realism of the virtual body is not high enough and/or when there is no spatial overlap between the two bodies, then the contribution of congruent multisensory and/or sensorimotor cues is required for evoking the illusion. On the basis of these results and inspired by findings from neurophysiological recordings in the monkey, we propose a model that accounts for many of the results reported in the literature.},

We expressed a common construct, {CAG}::{ChR}2 (H134R)-{EYFP}-{WPRE}, in L2/3 pyramidal cells in rat somatosensory cortex via in utero {DNA} electroporation ({IUE}). L2/3 pyramidal cells expressed {ChR}2-{EYFP}, but histology revealed abnormal morphology and targeting of {ChR}2-{EYFP} expressing axons, beginning at postnatal day (P) 33 and increasing with age. Axonal abnormalities included cylinders that enveloped pyramidal cell proximal apical dendrites, and spherical, calyx-like structures that surrounded neuronal cell bodies, including in L4. These are abnormal subcellular and laminar targets for L2/3 pyramidal cell synapses. Abnormalities did not occur in cells expressing {GFP} instead of {ChR}2, or in intermixed {ChR}2-negative axons. Long-term viral-mediated expression (80 d) did not cause axonal abnormalities when the {CAG} promoter was used, but produced some abnormalities with the stronger α{CaMKII} promoter (albeit much less than with in utero electroporation). Thus, under some circumstances high-level, long-term expression of {ChR}2-{EYFP} can perturb the structural organization of cortical circuits.},

Here we describe a method to control exocytosis of synaptic vesicles through the use of a light-gated glutamate receptor ({LiGluR}), which has recently been demonstrated that supports secretion by means of calcium influx in chromaffin cells. Expression of {LiGluR} in hippocampal neurons enables reversible control of neurotransmission with light, and allows modulating the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron with the wavelength of illumination. This method may be useful for the determination of the complex transfer function of individual synapses.},

	abstract = {Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that control the movement of ions across the cell membrane. They are the molecular machines that make neurons excitable by enabling the initiation and propagation of action potentials ({APs}). Rapid signaling within and between neurons requires complex molecular processes that couple the sensing of membrane voltage or neurotransmitter release to the fast opening and closing of the ion channel gate. Malfunction of an ion channel's sensing or gating module can have disastrous pathological consequences. However, linking molecular changes to the modulation of neural circuits and ultimately to a physiological or pathological state is not a straightforward task. It requires precise and sophisticated methods of controlling the function of ion channels in their native environment. To address this issue we have developed new photochemical tools that enable the remote control of neuronal ion channels with light. Due to its optical nature, our approach permits the manipulation of the nervous system with high spatial, temporal and molecular precision that will help us understand the link between ion channel function and physiology. In addition, this strategy may also be used in the clinic for the direct treatment of some neuronal disorders.},

The fluence rates in tumor-free brains agree well with the models based on diffusion theory and Monte Carlo simulation. In both cases, the best fit is found for absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of 0.57 and 28cm−1, respectively. In brains with implanted {BT}4C tumors, a discrepancy between diffusion and Monte Carlo–derived two-layer models is noted. Both models suggest that tumor tissue has higher absorption and less scattering than normal brain. Temperatures are measured by inserting thermocouples directly into tumor-free brains.

We use an optical model where {MRI}-segmented tissues are assumed homogeneous. We introduce a noise model capturing both photon shot noise and forward model numerical accuracy, and use Bayesian inference to predict errorbars and correlations on the measurments. We also sample from the full posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We conclude that {\textasciitilde} 106 detected photons are sufficient to measure the brain's scattering and absorption to a few percent.

	abstract = {A numerical simulation of the transport of light energy in the near infrared region of the spectrum through human brain tissue is presented. This simulation models the use of near infrared spectroscopic techniques to quantify the levels of oxygen present in brain tissue. Successful application of the technique requires knowledge of the optical pathlength in the tissue, and it is the goal of this simulation to quantify the relationship of the optical pathlength and the oxygenation state of the tissue. Both implicit and explicit finite element schemes for unstructured grids are implemented and discussed. Several application simulations using three tissue grids of varying degrees of physiological accuracy are then conducted, and figures for the optical pathlength of light through the tissue at varying levels of oxygenation are computed. These results are then used to develop a quantitative relationship between the pathlength and the absorption parameter for the three tissue models which we explore.},

	shorttitle = {Special issue on optical neural engineering},
	abstract = {Neural engineering, itself an 'emerging interdisciplinary research area' [1] has undergone a sea change over the past few years with the emergence of exciting new optical technologies for monitoring, stimulating, inhibiting and, more generally, modulating neural activity. To a large extent, this change is driven by the realization of the promise and complementary strengths that emerging photo-stimulation tools offer to add to the neural engineer's toolbox, which has been almost exclusively based on electrical stimulation technologies. Notably, photo-stimulation is non-contact, can in some cases be genetically targeted to specific cell populations, can achieve high spatial specificity (cellular or even sub-cellular) in two or three dimensions, and opens up the possibility of large-scale spatial–temporal patterned stimulation. It also offers a seamless solution to the problem of cross-talk generated by simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording. As in other biomedical optics phenomena [2], photo-stimulation includes multiple possible modes of interaction between light and the target neurons, including a variety of photo-physical and photo-bio–chemical effects with various intrinsic components or exogenous 'sensitizers' which can be loaded into the tissue or genetically expressed. Early isolated reports of neural excitation with light date back to the late 19th century [3] and to Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis' work five decades ago [4]; however, the mechanism by which these and other direct photo-stimulation, inhibition and modulation events [5–7] took place is yet unclear, as is their short- and long-term safety profile. Photo-chemical photolysis of covalently 'caged' neurotransmitters [8, 9] has been widely used in cellular neuroscience research for three decades, including for exciting or inhibiting neural activity, and for mapping neural circuits. Technological developments now allow neurotransmitters to be uncaged with exquisite spatial specificity (down to a single spine, with two-photon uncaging) and in rapid, flexible spatial–temporal patterns [10–14]. Nevertheless, current technology generally requires damaging doses of {UV} or violet illumination and the continuous re-introduction of the caged compound, which, despite interest, makes for a difficult transition beyond in vitro preparations. Thus, the tremendous progress in the in vivo application of photo-stimulation tools over the past five years has been largely facilitated by two 'exciting' new photo-stimulation technologies: photo-biological stimulation of a rapidly increasing arsenal of light-sensitive ion channels and pumps ('optogenetic' probes[15–18]) and direct photo-thermal stimulation of neural tissue with an {IR} laser [19–21]. The Journal of Neural Engineering has dedicated a special section in this issue to highlight advances in optical stimulation technology, which includes original peer-reviewed contributions dealing with the design of modern optical systems for spatial–temporal control of optical excitation patterns and with the biophysics of neural–thermal interaction mediated by electromagnetic waves. The paper by Nikolenko, Peterka and Yuste [22] presents a compact design of a microscope-photo-stimulator based on a transmissive phase-modulating spatial-light modulator ({SLM}). Computer-generated holographic photo-stimulation using {SLMs} [12–14, 23] allows the efficient parallel projection of intense sparse patterns of light, and the welcome development of compact, user-friendly systems will likely reduce the barrier to its widespread adoption. The paper by Losavio et al [24] presents the design and functional characteristics of their acousto-optical deflector ({AOD}) systems for studying spatial–temporal dendritic integration in single neurons in vitro. Both single-photon ({UV}) and two-photon (femtosecond pulsed {IR}) {AOD} uncaging systems are described in detail. The paper presents an excellent overview of the current state of the art and limitations of this technology, which is increasingly being applied for both photo- stimulation and imaging [25, 26]. Finally, the paper by Pikov et al [27] studies the modulatory biophysical effects exerted by low power millimeter waves on neuronal excitability and membrane properties of cortical pyramidal neurons in vitro. These extensive neuro-modulatory effects seem to include a thermal component (related to the photo-thermal effects observed under laser illumination [28]) as well as a more specific effect exerted by these lower frequency (sub-{THz}) electromagnetic waves. These new contributions augment five previous manuscripts published by the journal on optical stimulation technology, which reported the development of a fiber-based system for in vivo optogenetic cortical stimulation [29], patterned stimulation systems based on computer-generated holography [23] and on arrays of micro-{LEDs} [30] designed for an optical retina neuroprosthetic [31], and an integrated system for optical stimulation with microelectrode array recording [32]. Without doubt, many more will quickly follow as neural engineers and neuroscientists increasingly tackle the many challenges that this exciting area poses. We can all expect to hear much more in the near future about the biophysics and implementation of photo-physical neural-interaction mechanisms, the design of new optogenetic probes and patterned-stimulation systems (including stand-alone and implantable systems), further integration of electrodes and optical components into electro-optical neurostimulation systems, and rapid progress towards multiple medical applications for alleviating neurological disabilities and improving human health.

Optical stimulation of genetically targeted neurons expressing the light sensitive channel protein Channelrhodopsin ({ChR}2) has recently been reported as a means for millisecond temporal control of neuronal spiking activities with cell-type selectivity. This offers the prospect of enabling local delivery of optical stimulation and the simultaneous monitoring of the neural activity by electrophysiological means, both in the vicinity of and distant to the stimulation site. We report here a novel dual-modality hybrid device, which consists of a tapered coaxial optical waveguide ('optrode') integrated into a 100 element intra-cortical multi-electrode recording array. We first demonstrate the dual optical delivery and electrical recording capability of the single optrode in in vitro preparations of mouse retina, photo-stimulating the native retinal photoreceptors while recording light-responsive activities from ganglion cells. The dual-modality array device was then used in {ChR}2 transfected mouse brain slices. Specifically, epileptiform events were reliably optically triggered by the optrode and their spatiotemporal patterns were simultaneously recorded by the multi-electrode array.},

Classically, this approach has been constrained by limitations of lens-based and point-scanning illumination systems. Here we describe a microscope configuration that incorporates a nematic liquid-crystal spatial light modulator to generate holographic patterns of illumination. This microscope can produce illumination spots of variable size and number, and in patterns shaped to precisely match user-defined elements in a specimen. Using holographic illumination to photolyze caged glutamate in brain slices, we show that shaped excitation on segments of neuronal dendrites and simultaneous, multispot excitation of different dendrites enables precise spatial and rapid temporal control of glutamate receptor activation. By allowing the excitation volume shape to be tailored precisely, the holographic microscope provides an extremely flexible method for activation of various photosensitive proteins and small molecules.},

	abstract = {Neuroprosthetic retinal interfaces depend upon the ability to bypass the damaged photoreceptor layer and directly activate populations of retinal ganglion cells ({RGCs}). To date, the preferred approach to this task largely relies on electrode array implants. We are currently pursuing two alternative methods for light-based direct activation of the {RGCs}. The first method is based on applying caged glutamate over the retina and uncaging it locally to obtain {RGC} excitation. The second method is to artificially cause {RGCs} to express Channelrhodopsin {II} ({ChR}2), a light-gated cation channel. In addition to being non-contact, optical techniques lend themselves relatively easily to a variety of technologies for achieving patterned stimulation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing ({DLP} - {DMD}) technology, we have developed an optical stimulation system capable of controlled, large-scale, flexible stimulation of the retinal tissue with high temporal accuracy. In preliminary studies, we are performing patterned photo-stimulation experiments using samples of caged fluorescent probes and in rat retinas that were virally transfected with {ChR}2.},

The versatility of {DBS} as both a probe and modulator of neural circuits is making it a powerful tool to study the human brain, helping provide important details of the pathophysiology of circuit dysfunction.

Though considerable advances have been made, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of {DBS} remain unclear despite its clinical efficacy. It is now widely held that both excitation and inhibition can occur secondary to stimulation, and it is suspected that abnormal synchronized oscillations may also be important in the mechanism of {DBS}. Other potentially important processes, including blood flow changes, local and upstream neurogenesis, and the modulation of neurotransmitters through stimulation of bordering astrocytes are also being investigated. Recent research has suggested that the temporal pattern of {DBS} stimulation is also an important variable in {DBS} neuromodulation, yet the extent of its influence on {DBS} efficacy has yet to be determined. As high stimulation frequency alone does not appear to be sufficient for optimal symptom suppression, attention to stimulation pattern might lead to more effective symptom control and reduced side effects, possibly at a lower frequency. Stimulation pattern may be potentially amenable to therapeutic modulation and its role in the clinical efficacy of {DBS} should be addressed through further focus and research.},

	abstract = {The mammalian olfactory bulb ({OB}) contains a rich and highly heterogeneous network of local interneurons ({INs}). These {INs} undergo continuous turnover in the adult {OB} in a process known as “adult neurogenesis.” Although the overall magnitude of adult neurogenesis has been estimated, the detailed dynamics of the different subpopulations remains largely unknown. Here we present a novel preparation that enables long-term in vivo time-lapse imaging in the mouse {OB} through a chronic cranial window in a virtually unlimited number of sessions. Using this preparation, we followed the turnover of a specific neuronal population in the {OB}, the dopaminergic ({DA}) neurons, for as long as 9 months. By following the same population over long periods of time, we found clear addition and loss of {DA} neurons in the glomerular layer. Both cell addition and loss increased over time. The numbers of new {DA} cells were consistently and significantly higher than lost {DA} cells, suggesting a net increase in the size of this particular population with age. Over a 9 month period of adult life, the net addition of {DA} neurons reached ∼13\%. Our data argue that the fine composition of the bulbar {IN} network changes throughout adulthood rather than simply being replenished.},

	abstract = {The efficient transduction of postmitotic cells by adeno-associated virus ({AAV}) makes it an excellent vector to deliver marker, functional, or therapeutic genes to the mammalian brain. An attractive feature of {AAV} is that all the viral-coding sequences are removed when engineering the recombinant genome, thereby limiting the extent of cell toxicity and immune response that are often associated with viral gene transcription. Of the seven described {AAV} serotypes, {AAV} serotype-2 ({AAV}2) is the most studied gene-transfer vehicle for in the mammalian brain. A feature of {AAV}2 transduction in the brain is that the vector remains confined to the injection site and predominately infects neurons rather than glia (2-8). The limited diffusion of {AAV}2 vectors is beneficial for controlled gene delivery. For instance, targeting therapeutic genes only to brain structures showing pathology would eliminate complications associated with vector diffusion and subsequent expression in healthy structures, and is an important consideration when designing treatment strategies for localized neurodegenerative diseases. The same is true for other experimental paradigms, such as investigating the function of genes in specific brain structures or using marker genes in tract-tracing experiments. Although {AAV}2 vectors were shown to remain predominately at the injection site, one study demonstrated that the vector itself may undergo axonal transport in inter-regional systems (9).},

The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

	abstract = {Several variations of microelectrode arrays are used to record and stimulate intracortical neuronal activity. Bypassing the immune response to maintain a stable recording interface remains a challenge. Companies and researchers are continuously altering the material compositions and geometries of the arrays in order to discover a combination that allows for a chronic and stable electrode–tissue interface. From this interface, they wish to obtain consistent quality recordings and a stable, low impedance pathway for charge injection over extended periods of time. Despite numerous efforts, no microelectrode array design has managed to evade the host immune response and remain fully functional. This study is an initial effort comparing several microelectrode arrays with fundamentally different configurations for use in an implantable epilepsy prosthesis. Specifically, {NeuroNexus} (Michigan) probes, Cyberkinetics (Utah) Silicon and Iridium Oxide arrays, ceramic-based thin-film microelectrode arrays (Drexel), and Tucker-Davis Technologies ({TDT}) microwire arrays are evaluated over a 31-day period in an animal model. Microelectrodes are compared in implanted rats through impedance, charge capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, recording stability, and elicited immune response. Results suggest significant variability within and between microelectrode types with no clear superior array. Some applications for the microelectrode arrays are suggested based on data collected throughout the longitudinal study. Additionally, specific limitations of assaying biological phenomena and comparing fundamentally different microelectrode arrays in a highly variable system are discussed with suggestions on how to improve the reliability of observed results and steps needed to develop a more standardized microelectrode design.},

However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach. We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ({\textless}5 µm diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 µm along the full extent of the implant. Main results. Carbon fiber arrays were tested in {HVC} (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

Deep brain stimulation can provide striking tremor relief, but the introduction of stimulating electrodes deep in the substance of the brain carries significant risks, including those of hemorrhage. Here, we pioneer an alternative approach in which we noninvasively apply transcranial alternating current stimulation ({TACS}) over the motor cortex to induce phase cancellation of the rest tremor rhythm. We first identify the timing of cortical oscillations responsible for rest tremor in the periphery by delivering tremor-frequency stimulation over motor cortex but do not couple this stimulation to the on-going tremor-instead, the rhythms simply "drift" in and out of phase alignment with one another. Slow alternating periods of phase cancellation and reinforcement result, informing on the phase alignments that induce the greatest change in tremor amplitude. Next, we deliver stimulation at these specified phase alignments to demonstrate controlled suppression of the on-going tremor. With this technique we can achieve almost 50\% average reduction in resting tremor amplitude and in so doing form the basis of a closed-loop tremor-suppression therapy that could be extended to other oscillopathies.},

Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential ({LFP}) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with {NeuroRighter}, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

However, a major impediment in the advancement of this technology is the challenge of maintaining device performance during chronic implantation (months to years) due to complex intrinsic host responses such as gliosis or glial scarring. The objective of this review is to bring together research communities in neurobiology, tissue engineering, and neuroprosthetics to address the major obstacles encountered in the translation of neuroprosthetics technology into long-term clinical use. This article draws connections between specific challenges faced by current neuroprosthetics technology and recent advances in the areas of nerve tissue engineering and neurobiology. Within the context of the device–nervous system interface and central nervous system implants, areas of synergistic opportunity are discussed, including platforms to present cells with multiple cues, controlled delivery of bioactive factors, three-dimensional constructs and in vitro models of gliosis and brain injury, nerve regeneration strategies, and neural stem/progenitor cell biology. Finally, recent insights gained from the fields of developmental neurobiology and cancer biology are discussed as examples of exciting new biological knowledge that may provide fresh inspiration toward novel technologies to address the complexities associated with long-term neuroprosthetic device performance.},

To examine the mechanisms underlying hippocampal coding, here we measured the intracellular dynamics of place cells by combining in vivo whole-cell recordings with a virtual-reality system. Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits underlying navigation.},

Neural prosthetics that use simultaneously a variety of cognitive and motor signals can maximize the ability of patients to communicate and interact with the outside world. Although most studies have recorded electroencephalograms or spike activity, recent research shows that local field potentials ({LFPs}) offer a promising additional signal.

Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron–electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

The local field potential ({LFP}) reflects activity of many neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the {LFP} is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the {LFP}. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the {LFP} from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the {LFP} represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the {LFP} contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.},

	abstract = {Chronically implantable, closed-loop neuromodulation devices with concurrent sensing and stimulation hold promise for better understanding the nervous system and improving therapies for neurological disease. Concurrent sensing and stimulation are needed to maximize usable neural data, minimize time delays for closed-loop actuation, and investigate the instantaneous response to stimulation. Current systems lack concurrent sensing and stimulation primarily because of stimulation interference to neural signals of interest. While careful design of high performance amplifiers has proved useful to reduce disturbances in the system, stimulation continues to contaminate neural sensing due to biological effects like tissue-electrode impedance mismatch and constraints on stimulation parameters needed to deliver therapy. In this work we describe systematic methods to mitigate the effect of stimulation through a combination of sensing hardware, stimulation parameter selection, and classification algorithms that counter residual stimulation disturbances. To validate these methods we implemented and tested a completely implantable system for over one year in a large animal model of epilepsy. The system proved capable of measuring and detecting seizure activity in the hippocampus both during and after stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate an embedded algorithm that actuates neural modulation in response to seizure detection during stimulation, validating the capability to detect bioelectrical markers in the presence of therapy and titrate it appropriately. The capability to detect neural states in the presence of stimulation and optimally titrate therapy is a key innovation required for generalizing closed-loop neural systems for multiple disease states.},

We mapped multi-unit activity and {LFP} visual responses with sparse-noise at several cortical sites simultaneously. The cortical magnification factor near the recording sites was precisely estimated by track reconstruction. The new method combined experimental measurements together with a model of signal summation to obtain the cortical spread of the {LFP}. This new method could be extended to cortical areas that have topographic maps such as S1 or A1, and to cortical areas without functional columnar maps, such as rodent visual cortex. In macaque V1, the {LFP} was the sum of signals from a very local region, the radius of which was on average 250 μm. The {LFP}’s cortical spread varied across cortical layers, reaching a minimum value of 120 μm in layer 4B. An important functional consequence of the small cortical spread of the {LFP} is that the visual field maps of {LFP} and {MUA} recorded at a single electrode site were very similar. The similar spatial scale of the visual responses, the restricted cortical spread, and their laminar variation led to new insights about the sources and possible applications of the {LFP}.},

	abstract = {It was postulated that the perceived association of visual features is based on the synchronization of those neural signals that are activated by a coherent visual object. Two types of synchronized cortical signals were found by us in cat and monkey visual cortex, and were proposed as candidates for feature association: (1) stimulus-locked signals, evoked by transient retinal stimulation, and typically non-rhythmic; (2) oscillatory signals, induced by sustained stimuli, and typically not locked in their oscillation phases to stimulus events. Both types of signals can occur synchronously in those neurons that are activated by a common stimulus. Synchronized activities were found in paired recordings within vertical cortex columns, in separate columns of the same cortical area, and even between different cortical areas or hemispheres. The average phase difference between such common oscillatory events was typically close to zero ({\textless} 1 msec mean +/- 2 msec S.D.). For the dependence of synchronization from stimulus and receptive field properties, a preliminary 'rule' can be given: the coherence of fast oscillations in separate cortical assemblies depends inversely on the 'coding distance' between the assemblies' {RF} properties, but directly on the degree of overlap between the assemblies' respective coding properties and the features of a common stimulus. This means that oscillatory events in any two assemblies, in the same or in different cortical areas or hemispheres, are more closely correlated the more similar are their receptive field properties, and the better a common stimulus activates the assemblies simultaneously. Our results can explain some neural mechanisms of perceptual feature-linking, including mutual enhancement among similar, spatially and temporally dispersed features, definitions of spatial and temporal continuity, scene segmentation, and figure-ground discrimination. We further propose that mutual enhancement and synchronization of cell activities are general principles of temporal coding by assemblies, that are also used within and among other sensory modalities as well as between cortical sensory and motor systems.},

In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation ({HFS}), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The {HFS} of the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias.

In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, {HFS} has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive–compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in {PET} scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction.

In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that {STN} stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in {MPTP}-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel {IPGs}, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain–computer interfaces. The new field of compensation of deficits will then become part of the field of functional neurosurgery.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces ({BCIs}) include stimulators, infusion devices, and neuroprostheses. They all belong to functional neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulators ({DBS}) are widely used for therapy and are in need of innovative evolutions. Robotized exoskeletons require {BCIs} able to drive up to 26 degrees of freedom ({DoF}). We report the nanomicrotechnology development of prototypes for new 3D {DBS} and for motor neuroprostheses. For this complex project, all compounds have been designed and are being tested. Experiments were performed in rats and primates for proof of concepts and development of the electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recognition algorithm.
{METHODS}: Various devices have been designed. (A) In human, a programmable multiplexer connecting five tetrapolar (20 contacts) electrodes to one {DBS} channel has been designed and implanted bilaterally into {STN} in two Parkinsonian patients. (B) A 50-mm diameter titanium implant, telepowered, including a radioset, emitting {ECoG} data recorded by a 64-electrode array using an application-specific integrated circuit, is being designed to be implanted in a 50-mm trephine opening. Data received by the radioreceiver are processed through an original wavelet-based Iterative N-way Partial Least Square algorithm ({INPLS}, {CEA} patent). Animals, implanted with {ECoG} recording electrodes, had to press a lever to obtain a reward. The brain signature associated to the lever press ({LP}) was detected online by {ECoG} processing using {INPLS}. This detection allowed triggering the food dispenser.
{RESULTS}: (A) The 3D multiplexer allowed tailoring the electrical field to the {STN}. The multiplication of the contacts affected the battery life and suggested different implantation schemes. (B) The components of the human implantable cortical {BCI} are being tested for reliability and toxicology to meet criteria for chronicle implantation in 2012. (C) In rats, the algorithm {INPLS} could detect the cortical signature with an accuracy of about 80\% of {LPs} on the electrodes with the best correlation coefficient (located over the cerebellar cortex), 1\% of the algorithm decisions were false positives. We aim to pilot effectors with {DoF} up to 3 in monkeys.
{CONCLUSION}: We have designed multielectrodes wireless implants to open the way for {BCI} {ECoG}-driven effectors. These technologies are also used to develop new generations of brain stimulators, either cortical or for deep targets. This chapter is aimed at illustrating that {BCIs} are actually the daily background of {DBS}, that the evolution of the method involves a growing multiplicity of targets and indications, that new technologies make possible and simpler than before to design innovative solutions to improve {DBS} methodology, and that the coming out of {BCI}-driven neuroprostheses for compensation of motor and sensory deficits is a natural evolution of functional neurosurgery.},

	note = {Chaotic systems perform well as a new rich source of
cryptography and pseudo-random coding. Unfortunately their digital
dynamical properties would degrade due to the finite computing
precision. Proposed in this paper is a modified digital chaotic
sequence generator based on chaotic logistic systems with a coupling
structure where one chaotic subsystem generates perturbation signals
to disturb the control parameter of the other one. The numerical
simulations show that the length of chaotic orbits, the output
distribution of chaotic system, and the security of chaotic
sequences have been greatly improved. Moreover the chaotic sequence
period can be extended at least by one order of magnitude longer
than that of the uncoupled logistic system and the difficulty in
decrypting increases 2$^{\textrm{128}}$*2$^{\textrm{128}}$ times indicating that the
dynamical degradation of digital chaos is effectively improved. A
field programmable gate array ({FPGA}) implementation of an algorithm
is given and the corresponding experiment shows that the output
speed of the generated chaotic sequences can reach 571.4{\textasciitilde}Mbps
indicating that the designed generator can be applied to the
real-time video image encryption.},

The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

Bypassing the immune response to maintain a stable recording interface remains a challenge. Companies and researchers are continuously altering the material compositions and geometries of the arrays in order to discover a combination that allows for a chronic and stable electrode–tissue interface. From this interface, they wish to obtain consistent quality recordings and a stable, low impedance pathway for charge injection over extended periods of time. Despite numerous efforts, no microelectrode array design has managed to evade the host immune response and remain fully functional. This study is an initial effort comparing several microelectrode arrays with fundamentally different configurations for use in an implantable epilepsy prosthesis. Specifically, {NeuroNexus} (Michigan) probes, Cyberkinetics (Utah) Silicon and Iridium Oxide arrays, ceramic-based thin-film microelectrode arrays (Drexel), and Tucker-Davis Technologies ({TDT}) microwire arrays are evaluated over a 31-day period in an animal model. Microelectrodes are compared in implanted rats through impedance, charge capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, recording stability, and elicited immune response. Results suggest significant variability within and between microelectrode types with no clear superior array. Some applications for the microelectrode arrays are suggested based on data collected throughout the longitudinal study. Additionally, specific limitations of assaying biological phenomena and comparing fundamentally different microelectrode arrays in a highly variable system are discussed with suggestions on how to improve the reliability of observed results and steps needed to develop a more standardized microelectrode design.},

However, stable recordings from small, densely packed neurons remains challenging, particularly over time-scales relevant for learning. Approach. We describe an assembly method for a 16-channel electrode array consisting of carbon fibers ({\textless}5 µm diameter) individually insulated with Parylene-C and fire-sharpened. The diameter of the array is approximately 26 µm along the full extent of the implant. Main results. Carbon fiber arrays were tested in {HVC} (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

	abstract = {Chronically implanted recording electrode arrays linked to prosthetics have the potential to make positive impacts on patients suffering from full or partial paralysis. Such arrays are implanted into the patient's cortical tissue and record extracellular potentials from nearby neurons, allowing the information encoded by the neuronal discharges to control external devices. While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design. This review presents the biological components and time course of the acute and chronic tissue reaction in brain tissue, analyses the brain tissue response of current electrode systems, and comments on the various material science and bioactive strategies undertaken by electrode designers to enhance electrode performance.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Several toxin-induced animals models simulate the motor deficits occurring in {PD}. Among them, the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-{OHDA}) model is frequently used in rats and has the advantage of presenting side-biased motor impairments. However, the behavioral consequences of a unilateral 6-{OHDA}-lesion have, so far, not been described in detail in mice. The aim of this study was to characterize mice with unilateral 6-{OHDA}-lesions placed in the median forebrain bundle using several motor behavioral tests in order to identify the most suitable predictor of nigral cell loss. Mice underwent various drug-induced (amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation) and spontaneous motor tests (cylinder, rotarod, elevated body swing, and stride length test). The amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. This study demonstrates that substantial and stable unilateral 6-{OHDA}-induced lesions can be established in mice, and that these lesions can be functionally assessed using several different side-bias-based behavioral tests. This mouse model offers the opportunity to use transgenic mouse strains and study the interactions between genes of interest and toxins in relation to Parkinson's disease etiology in the future.},

	abstract = {Relative proportions of peripheral blood ({PB}) B lymphocytes (B220\%) as well as {CD}4 ({CD}4\%) and {CD}8 ({CD}8\%) T lymphocytes differ significantly among inbred mouse strains: B220\% is high in C57BL/6J (B6) and C57BR/{cdJ}, intermediate in {BALB}/{cByJ} ({BALB}) and {DBA}/2J (D2), and low in {NOD}/{LtJ} ({NOD}) and {SJL}/J ({SJL}) mice, whereas {CD}4\% and {CD}8\% are high in {NOD} and {SJL} mice and low in the other 4 strains. By following segregating genetic markers linked to these traits in (B6 x D2) recombinant inbred ({BXD} {RI}) mice, the study defined 2 quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) for the B220\% phenotype: Pbbcp1 (peripheral blood B cell percentage 1, logarithm of odds [{LOD}] 4.1, P {\textless}.000 01) and Pbbcp2 ({LOD} 3.7, P {\textless}.000 04) on chromosome 1 (Chr 1) at about 63 {cM} and 48 {cM}; one suggestive locus for the {CD}4\% phenotype ({LOD} 2.6, P {\textless}.000 57) on Chr 8 at about 73 {cM}; and one {QTL} for the {CD}8\% phenotype: Pbctlp1 (peripheral blood cytotoxic T lymphocyte percentage 1, {LOD} 3.8, P {\textless}.000 02) on Chr 19 at about 12 {cM}. The study further segregated {PB} lymphocyte proportions in B6SJLF2 mice by using {DNA} markers adjacent to these mapped {QTLs} and found that the Pbbcp1 locus ({LOD} 5.6, P {\textless}.000 01) was also important in this mouse population. In both {BXD} {RI} and B6SJLF2 mice, {QTLs} regulating B-cell proportions showed no significant effect on T-cell proportions and vice versa. Thus, {PB} B- and T-lymphocyte proportions are regulated separately by different genetic elements.},

	abstract = {The design of a macroscope constructed with photography lenses is described and several applications are demonstrated. The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

Typically, laser speckle contrast imaging is performed using scientific-grade instrumentation. However, due to recent advances in camera technology, these expensive components may not be necessary to produce accurate images. In this paper, we demonstrate that a consumer-grade webcam can be used to visualize changes in flow, both in a microfluidic flow phantom and in vivo in a mouse model. A two-camera setup was used to simultaneously image with a high performance monochrome {CCD} camera and the webcam for direct comparison. The webcam was also tested with inexpensive aspheric lenses and a laser pointer for a complete low-cost, compact setup (\$90, 5.6 cm length, 25 g). The {CCD} and webcam showed excellent agreement with the two-camera setup, and the inexpensive setup was used to image dynamic blood flow changes before and after a targeted cerebral occlusion.},

	abstract = {In the last few years two-photon microscopy has been used to perform in vivo high spatial resolution imaging of neurons, glial cells and vascular structures in the intact neocortex. Recently, in parallel to its applications in imaging, multi-photon absorption has been used as a tool for the selective disruption of neural processes and blood vessels in living animals. In this review we present some basic features of multi-photon nanosurgery and we illustrate the advantages offered by this novel methodology in neuroscience research. We show how the spatial localization of multi-photon excitation can be exploited to perform selective lesions on cortical neurons in living mice expressing fluorescent proteins. This methodology is applied to disrupt a single neuron without causing any visible collateral damage to the surrounding structures. The spatial precision of this method allows to dissect single processes as well as individual dendritic spines, preserving the structural integrity of the main neuronal arbor. The same approach can be used to breach the blood-brain barrier through a targeted photo-disruption of blood vessels walls. We show how the vascular system can be perturbed through laser ablation leading toward two different models of stroke: intravascular clot and extravasation. Following the temporal evolution of the injured system (either a neuron or a blood vessel) through time lapse in vivo imaging, the physiological response of the target structure and the rearrangement of the surrounding area can be characterized. Multi-photon nanosurgery in live brain represents a useful tool to produce different models of neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {In the last few years two-photon microscopy has been used to perform in vivo high spatial resolution imaging of neurons, glial cells and vascular structures in the intact neocortex. Recently, in parallel to its applications in imaging, multi-photon absorption has been used as a tool for the selective disruption of neural processes and blood vessels in living animals. In this review we present some basic features of multi-photon nanosurgery and we illustrate the advantages offered by this novel methodology in neuroscience research. We show how the spatial localization of multi-photon excitation can be exploited to perform selective lesions on cortical neurons in living mice expressing fluorescent proteins. This methodology is applied to disrupt a single neuron without causing any visible collateral damage to the surrounding structures. The spatial precision of this method allows to dissect single processes as well as individual dendritic spines, preserving the structural integrity of the main neuronal arbor. The same approach can be used to breach the blood-brain barrier through a targeted photo-disruption of blood vessels walls. We show how the vascular system can be perturbed through laser ablation leading toward two different models of stroke: intravascular clot and extravasation. Following the temporal evolution of the injured system (either a neuron or a blood vessel) through time lapse in vivo imaging, the physiological response of the target structure and the rearrangement of the surrounding area can be characterized. Multi-photon nanosurgery in live brain represents a useful tool to produce different models of neurodegenerative disease.},

Here we describe in detail a protocol for imaging cortical structures at high optical resolution through a thinned-skull cranial window in live mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy ({TPLSM}). Surgery can be performed within 30–45 min and images can be acquired immediately thereafter. The procedure can be repeated multiple times allowing longitudinal imaging of the cortex over intervals ranging from days to years. Imaging through a thinned-skull cranial window avoids exposure of the meninges and the cortex, thus providing a minimally invasive approach for studying structural and functional changes of cells under normal and pathological conditions in the living brain.},

	abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of “primary states” is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit “criticality,” i.e., the property of being poised at a “critical” point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network ({DMN}) and a decoupling between the {DMN} and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to ∼2-5 μm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of {\textless}5\%.},

Here we present a microscope that rapidly sections a three-dimensional volume using a thin illumination sheet whose position is rigidly coupled to the objective and aligned with its focal plane. We demonstrate that this approach allows exceptionally low-noise imaging of large neuronal populations at pixel rates at least 100-fold higher than with {LSM}. Using this microscope, we studied the pheromone-sensing neurons of the mouse vomeronasal organ and found that responses to dilute urine are largely or exclusively restricted to cells in the apical layer, the location of V1r-family-expressing neurons.},

A probe constructed from optical fibers is used to deliver excitation light and collect fluorescence from seven positions, each 1 mm apart, through the left ventricle wall of the rabbit heart. Excitation is provided by the 488-nm line of a water-cooled argon-ion laser. The fluorescence of the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-{ANEPPS} from each tissue site is split at 600 nm and imaged onto separate photodiodes for later signal ratioing. The optics and electronics are easily expandable to accommodate multiple optical probes.

	abstract = {This chapter provides qualitative descriptions of a variety of lighting and viewing methods ({LVMs}). These are presented in alphabetical order, since there is no natural structure for such a list (Table 40.1 ). There are usually five elements within an image acquisition sub-system: light source, illumination optics, image-enhancement optics, main lens and sensor. The positions of these relative to each other and the object being observed must be carefully selected, to obtain a digital image that is easy to process electronically. The physical layout of the optical sub-system and the choice of appropriate components are of equal importance. Chapter 7 describes the light sources available, while optical components are discussed in Chaps. 5 and 6. Scanners and cameras and are described in Chaps. 9 and 10 respectively. Chapter 8 explains some of the concepts necessary to appreciate the methods described here. Of particular note is that of an illumination diagram. This explains, in graphical form, the shape and position and of the light source in relation to the widget and camera. Notice that the diagrams included in this chapter are not drawn to scale; they merely suggest a design for the lighting-viewing sub-system in broad conceptual terms. A multitude of combinations of the methods described below is possible.

When designing the image acquisition sub-system, a vision engineer should normally follows the following steps: Look at the widget In a darkened room, move a “point” light source round the widget. Rotate the widget as well. Watch the way that its appearance changes Repeat (a) using a broad light source (e.g., stand in front of a window). Ensure that no light falls on the widget from any other direction Bearing in mind the observations in step (1), consult the {LVM} Catalogue. Choose one or a few possible lighting-viewing methods Build a prototype lighting-viewing sub-system based on the idea(s) suggested by the catalogue Acquire some sample images Process these images using an interactive image processing system, such as {QT} (Chaps. 21 and 41) or Neat Vision (Chap. 22) Adjust the lighting-viewing sub-system and repeat steps (4) to (5), until satisfactory results are obtained Design and build the target system based on the prototype Step (1) is very simple, yet it is always in danger of being omitted. The phrase that summarises this design process is “Experiment, look and observe”. Over a period of many years, involving numerous applications, the author has found this procedure to be very effective indeed. Never attempt to design an image acquisition system without moving from the desk!.},

Here we consider a less explored phenomenon; namely gamma frequency synchronisation of neurons in the basal ganglia. Gamma oscillations have been reported in a distributed network involving the basal ganglia, thalamus and motor cortex, and have been described in a wide range of diseases as well as during increased arousal and voluntary movement. In Parkinson's disease, gamma activity is promoted by dopaminergic therapy. These features suggest that its elevation may be involved in the production of movement and this hypothesis is supported by the correlation between the amplitude of gamma activity and limb kinematics. Here we review these data, discuss the functional anatomy of gamma activity in basal ganglia and question how closely it relates to the coding of movement parameters.},

One promising approach to this goal is fluorescence imaging, but existing methods using laser-scanning microscopy ({LSM}) are severely limited in their ability to resolve rapid phenomena, like neuronal action potentials, over wide fields. Here we present a microscope that rapidly sections a three-dimensional volume using a thin illumination sheet whose position is rigidly coupled to the objective and aligned with its focal plane. We demonstrate that this approach allows exceptionally low-noise imaging of large neuronal populations at pixel rates at least 100-fold higher than with {LSM}. Using this microscope, we studied the pheromone-sensing neurons of the mouse vomeronasal organ and found that responses to dilute urine are largely or exclusively restricted to cells in the apical layer, the location of V1r-family-expressing neurons.},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to ∼2-5 μm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of {\textless}5\%.},

Here we optically imaged the spatial and temporal activity patterns of neuronal populations in mice performing a {PPC}-dependent task that combined a perceptual decision and memory-guided navigation in a virtual environment. Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales ({\textless}100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the {PPC} may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.},

By expressing {VSFPs} in pyramidal cells of mouse somatosensory cortex, we also demonstrate that these probes can report cortical electrical responses to single sensory stimuli in vivo. These protein-based voltage probes will facilitate the analysis of cortical circuits in genetically defined cell populations and are hence a valuable addition to the optogenetic toolbox.},

Here we introduce a miniature (1.9 g) integrated fluorescence microscope made from mass-producible parts, including a semiconductor light source and sensor. This device enables high-speed cellular imaging across {\textasciitilde}0.5 mm2 areas in active mice. This capability allowed concurrent tracking of Ca2+ spiking in {\textgreater}200 Purkinje neurons across nine cerebellar microzones. During mouse locomotion, individual microzones exhibited large-scale, synchronized Ca2+ spiking. This is a mesoscopic neural dynamic missed by prior techniques for studying the brain at other length scales. Overall, the integrated microscope is a potentially transformative technology that permits distribution to many animals and enables diverse usages, such as portable diagnostics or microscope arrays for large-scale screens.},

The combined anatomical index of the multiple brain atlas database containing complementary 2-D and 3-D atlases has about 1000 structures per hemisphere, and over 400 sulcal patterns. Neurosurgical planning with mutually preregistered multiple brain atlases in all three orthogonal orientations is novel. The approach is validated with 24 intraoperative and postoperative datasets for thalamotomies, thalamic stimulations, pallidotomies, and pallidal stimulations. Its potential benefits include increased accuracy of target definition, reduced time of the surgical procedure by decreasing the number of tracts, facilitated planning of more sophisticated trajectories, lowered cost by reducing the number of microelectrodes used, reduced surgical complications, and the extra degree of confidence given to the neurosurgeon.},

Results show that our method is well suited to aggregate many surgical constraints and allows the analysis of thousands of trajectories in less than 1/10th of the time for manual planning. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of computed trajectories resulted in the identification of potential new constraints, which are not addressed in the current literature, to better mimic the decision-making of the neurosurgeon during {DBS} planning.},

At magnifications of 1 × to 2.5 ×, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100–700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5–10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain.

Our system uses {LED} ring lights that can be mounted on standard microscope objectives or video lenses to provide a homogeneous and stable light source, with less than 0.003\% fluctuation across images averaged from 40 trials. We describe the equipment and surgical techniques necessary for both acute and chronic mouse preparations, and provide software that can create maps of sensory representations from images captured by inexpensive 8-bit cameras or by 12-bit cameras. The {IOS} imaging system can be adapted to commercial upright microscopes or custom macroscopes, eliminating the need for dedicated equipment or complex optical paths.

The sensitivity profile of each probe is determined by measuring the relative intensity of light backscattered off a flat surface as a function of distance from the probe tip. The experimental results are compared with a simple light-cone-overlap model incorporating fiber numerical aperture, fiber and immersion medium refractive indices, separation between excitation and collection fibers, number of fibers, and fiber bevel angle and/or lens focal length. The model and sensitivity profiles are used to interpret the sampling regions for Raman spectra obtained by using each of the probes with a clear, transparent sample (single-crystal sparry calcite), a white, partially transparent sample (acetaminophen tablet), and a set of organic liquids of varying refractive index. The sensitivity of the tested commercial lensed probe drops off symmetrically about the focal point. For both solid samples, the intensity of fiber background follows a profile determined primarily by laser backscattering off the surface, whereas the sample Raman signal follows a profile dependent upon sampling depth.},

This principle has been used to establish an equivalence between conventional widefield microscopes and scanning microscopes. We make use of this principle to introduce a scanning version of oblique back-illumination microscopy, or {sOBM}. This technique provides sub-surface phase-gradient and amplitude images from unlabeled tissue, in an epi-detection geometry. That is, it may be applied to arbitrarily thick tissue. {sOBM} may be implemented as a simple, cost-effective add-on with any scanning microscope, requiring only the availability of an extra input channel in the microscope electronics. We demonstrate here its implementation in combination with two-photon excited fluorescence ({TPEF}) microscopy and with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering ({CARS}) microscopy, applied to brain or spinal cord tissue imaging. In both cases, {sOBM} provides information on tissue morphology complementary to {TPEF} or {CARS} contrast. This information is obtained simultaneously and is automatically co-registered. Finally, we show that {sOBM} can be operated at video rate.},

	abstract = {Much progress has been made in uncovering the computational capabilities of spiking neural networks. However, spiking neurons will always be more expensive to simulate compared to rate neurons because of the inherent disparity in time scales - the spike duration time is much shorter than the inter-spike time, which is much shorter than any learning time scale. In numerical analysis, this is a classic stiff problem. Spiking neurons are also much more difficult to study analytically. One possible approach to making spiking networks more tractable is to augment mean field activity models with some information about spiking correlations. For example, such a generalized activity model could carry information about spiking rates and correlations between spikes self-consistently. Here, we will show how this can be accomplished by constructing a complete formal probabilistic description of the network and then expanding around a small parameter such as the inverse of the number of neurons in the network. The mean field theory of the system gives a rate-like description. The first order terms in the perturbation expansion keep track of covariances.},

Our general methodology is broadly applicable to many deep brain regions and areas of the body. Microendoscopes are available in a wide variety of optical designs, allowing imaging across a range of spatial scales and with spatial resolution that can now closely approach that offered by standard water-immersion microscope objectives. The incorporation of microendoscope probes into portable miniaturized microscopes allows imaging in freely behaving animals. When combined with the broad sets of available fluorescent markers, animal preparations, and genetically modified mice, microendoscopic methods enable sophisticated experimental designs for probing how cellular characteristics may underlie or reflect animal behavior and life experience, in healthy animals and animal models of disease.},

Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil.

	abstract = {Intracranial self-stimulation ({ICSS}) is an operant behavioral paradigm in which experimental animals learn to deliver brief electrical pulses into specific regions of their own brains that are considered to be part of the brain’s reward pathways mediating both natural and {ICSS} reward. Several brain sites support {ICSS}, with the lateral hypothalamus, medial forebrain ({MFB}) bundle, and ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) among the sites that produce the most vigorous {ICSS} responding. Various {ICSS} procedures have been designed and used during the last decades since the discovery of {ICSS}. Two of the most commonly used {ICSS} procedures, which have been experimentally validated and have shown to be reward-selective, are the rate-frequency curve-shift procedure and the discrete-trial current-intensity threshold procedure. In all {ICSS} procedures, lowering of {ICSS} thresholds indicates a facilitation of brain stimulation reward, whereas elevations in {ICSS} thresholds reflect the diminished reward value of the stimulation and thus an anhedonic state. Acute administration of most drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, morphine, and heroin, lower {ICSS} thresholds in experimental animals. By contrast, withdrawal from chronic administration of these compounds induces elevations in {ICSS} thresholds, indicating an anhedonic state that resembles the negative affective state of the drug withdrawal syndrome experienced by humans. However, certain drugs of abuse, such as ethanol and cannabinoids, have shown inconsistent effects in {ICSS} procedures, primarily because of the minimal effects induced by these drugs in the {ICSS} procedure. In summary, the {ICSS} procedure provides unique ways to investigate the anatomical basis of reward and motivation and is an important tool for the assessment of the reward-facilitating and anhe­donic effects of various drugs of abuse with addictive properties.},

Much of what we know about drug abuse and drug reward comes from research involving stimulants, and much of this research involves using drug self-administration as an animal model of drug abuse. In this chapter, the example of stimulant self-administration is used to illustrate: (1) the basic methodology of drug self-administration procedures and (2) the behavioral principles that apply to addiction and animal models of addiction. Many variations of the self-administration procedure have been developed to model specific aspects of drug abuse, to assess the rewarding effects of drugs, and to assess the effects of treatments. The chapter describes how these variations are devised by stipulating the behavioral requirements for receiving the drug (i.e., the schedule of reinforcement) and incorporating drug-related environmental cues analogous to those that occur in the human drug-abuse environment.},

We have placed great emphasis on the development of behavioral procedures whereby animals not only self-administer drugs, but pathologically seek and take drugs in a way that resembles the clinical condition in human drug addicts. Thus, over the last 10 years we have developed models in rats that specifically address the development of habitual drug seeking behavior, compulsive cocaine seeking and taking behavior, and even addiction-like behavior. In this chapter, we review the behavioral procedures, namely second-order schedules of reinforcement, two-link heterogeneous chained schedules of reinforcement and the “three addiction-like behavioral criteria selection procedure” that we have used in rats to model habitual drug seeking behavior, compulsive drug seeking and taking behavior and addiction-like behavior. Although not yet widely adopted, these models have already contributed to the identification of some neurobiological and psychological mechanisms involved in the vulnerability to drug addiction and the transition from controlled to compulsive drug use, thereby emphasizing their great heuristic value in attempts to understand drug addiction.},

Calcium-dependent signaling pathways contribute importantly to both the induction and expression of sensitization by these drugs. In particular, calcium-calmodulin ({CaM})-dependent protein kinase {II} ({CaMKII}), a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in forebrain regions such as the {NAcc}, is known to contribute to the expression of several forms of plasticity including sensitization. Notably, pharmacologically inhibiting {CaMKII} in the {NAcc} prevents the expression of sensitized locomotion, {NAcc} {DA} overflow, and drug taking. Evidence indicates that {CaMKII} may act both pre- and postsynaptically in this site to influence the expression of these manifestations of sensitization. Presynaptically in {DA} neuron terminals, {CaMKII} regulates sensitized {DA} overflow. Postsynaptically in medium spiny neurons, it contributes to the upregulation of {AMPA} receptors, the activation of which is necessary for the expression of sensitization. It is conceivable that interactions between {CaMKII}-mediated neuroadaptations in both of these sites may underlie the long-lasting maintenance of sensitization by psychostimulant drugs.},

The chapter first includes a brief discussion of current clinical conceptions of craving. This is followed by an argument for what aspect of human craving animals may experience. This leads to a description of various animal models (primarily using rats) that indirectly measure activity of a basic craving mechanism. A final section is provided with examples of the utility of animal models of craving illustrated with translational evidence. It is argued that basic craving is amenable to study by animal models of craving that measure motivated drug seeking behavior. Furthermore, reflection on a distinction between conscious (subjective) craving and basic craving leads to the following possible conclusions: one could treat the conscious craving and this would provide some benefit to the addict. But what would remain is the basic craving response to drug-paired stimuli, situations, and even drug-focused thought processes. Reducing basic craving using pharmaco- or behavioral therapies based upon animal model findings may ultimately be more effective at reducing relapse behaviors.},

Animal models of eating disorders are not as well established as those that model drug addiction, but the research in this area is progressing rapidly. In this chapter, we discuss anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and obesity as these encompass the majority of maladaptive eating behaviors in humans. We begin by outlining the important features that characterize each disorder and that should thereby be present in an animal model. An overview of peptide control of feeding is provided to help the reader evaluate the animal models presented. These are based principally on genetic variation and stressful life events. In general, most animal models based on genetic alterations have limited applicability to humans, at least to date. Those based on stressful life events appear more promising in that they more accurately reproduce alterations in feeding and neuroendocrine function that are characteristic of each disorder. The next obvious step in eating disorder research is to combine the two approaches to determine how genetic alterations and stressful events interact to produce maladaptive eating and physiological changes.},

The chapter covers behavioral procedures modeling different stages of the alcohol addiction cycle, including strategies for investigating ethanol reinforcement, ethanol dependence, binge drinking, ethanol craving, and susceptibility to relapse. Moreover, the description and evaluation of the utility of these models is presented within a historical context, as well as an assessment of specific needs for future model development. The chapter emphasizes that the primary objective of contemporary research on alcohol abuse and addiction is to explain the processes that compel some but not other individuals to drink excessively, the identification of brain mechanisms that support the acute reinforcing actions of alcohol in nondependent subjects, and abnormalities in these mechanisms that are responsible for the development of dependence and the compulsive character of ethanol seeking and use in alcohol-addicted individuals. With respect to the development and successful implementation of valid animal models of self-administration and addiction, a number of issues must be considered in the case of alcohol due to the fact that (a) voluntary alcohol consumption in animals is generally low, except in animals that have been genetically selected for high spontaneous ethanol preference, and (b) that the conditions that make excessive alcohol consumption a reinforcing event in some subjects and not others are complex because they involve interactions among genetic, psychosocial-environmental, and neurobiological factors. Despite these challenges, a wide array of animal models is available that permits investigation of behaviors directed at obtaining access to and consuming alcohol as well as the identification of neurobiological, genetic, environmental, and motivational factors regulating these behaviors in both the nondependent and dependent states. These models also are instrumental for identifying pharmacological treatment targets for intervention at different stages of the addiction cycle and as preclinical tools for evaluating the efficacy of potential medications for the treatment of excessive alcohol use and the prevention of alcohol craving and relapse.},

However, the conditions under which nicotine self-administration has been observed do not closely model the way in which nicotine is consumed by cigarette smokers, in two important respects: conventional {IVSA} procedures typically employ ultra-rapid infusions and high unit doses of nicotine that approximate the content of one or two cigarettes. In contrast, recent evidence shows that rats will also self-administer nicotine in doses equivalent to about two cigarette puffs, delivered into the circulation at a much slower rate that more closely approximates the delivery rate in cigarette smokers. Possibly, adoption of these refinements will help to provide an animal model with greater predictive clinical validity in order to advance the search for more effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.},

Under appropriate experimental conditions, a satiety level can be altered by physiological dependence or pain. Furthermore, during self-administration, there are several sources of learning that will modulate drug intake. It is concluded that these drives and learning dynamically interact with each other to influence the direction and the strength of opiate habits.},

Over the past several decades, the reinstatement procedure has received widespread use as an animal model of drug relapse, to study the basic mechanisms underlying drug-seeking responses in laboratory animals. The objectives of this chapter are twofold. The first is to describe the primary paradigms and procedures that have been developed to study reinstatement of drug-related behaviors in the laboratory. The second is to define and characterize the three major triggers of reinstatement to drug seeking that constitute the foundation of this work. These triggers include priming injections of a previously self-administered drug, reexposure to drug-associated cues, and exposure to stress. The role of these triggers in reinstatement will be characterized within the context of an overview of key behavioral findings in the literature and their theoretical implications.},

	abstract = {Drugs of abuse generate diverse behavioral and physiological effects. One feature common to many abused drugs is the phenomenon of “withdrawal,” which results from abrupt termination of drug administration. The initial phases of drug withdrawal, often referred to as the “crash” phase in humans, are characterized by dramatic psychological changes which may or may not be accompanied by somatic symptoms. The psychological symptoms, including disruptions in affect and cognition, are most commonly observed following psychostimulant withdrawal. This transient state strongly resembles the symptoms of major depressive disorder ({MDD}) in humans. The majority of rodent paradigms of psychostimulant withdrawal accurately model this human condition, and sophisticated preclinical protocols have been used to quantify psychological changes, such as anhedonia. In the present review, we describe past and current progress in modeling psychostimulant withdrawal in rodents, as well as potential limitations of this model.},

Experimental binges provide a valid model for examining aspects of the gradual progression from drug use to abuse, particularly when attempting to identify environmental and genetic factors that may prompt intermittent behavioral routines to become dysregulated, as exemplified during cycles of bingeing. Here we explore binge behavior in animals with a particular focus on data obtained from self-administration studies that utilize conditions that allow for both unrestricted and prolonged access to cocaine, opiates, alcohol or food. Many behavioral and neural effects of bingeing are shared between these substances, indicating that the repetitive nature of binge behavior for many types of drug abuse may be related to the dysregulation of common neural circuits. Interestingly, intense bingeing occurs with the emergence of two potential changes in behavior; an increase in the rate or an increase in the persistence of behavioral responding. These two changes indicate that control over bingeing may be determined by a number of processes, including sensitization, tolerance, and withdrawal.},

At its core, impulsivity arises through an inability to adequately suppress or inhibit inappropriate behaviour and by a general intolerance to delayed gratification, a tendency also widely found in abstinent drug addicts. Despite intensive research, however, it remains unclear whether impulsivity arises from neural abnormalities produced by the chronic exposure of individuals to drugs such as alcohol and cocaine (‘state impulsivity’) potentially via interactions with medial temporal lobe and frontal cortical structures (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or whether instead ‘trait impulsivity’ and brain disorders linked to it – for example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) – predispose to drug use and addiction.

	abstract = {A variety of animal models have been developed to mimic the interactions between drugs and environment that are thought to play a crucial role in human addiction. A history of exposure to stress, for example, facilitates the development of drug addiction and drug relapse. Furthermore, there is solid evidence that drug-related contextual cues (i.e., environmental stimuli paired with drug taking that have acquired conditioned stimulus properties) can precipitate drug seeking in both humans and animals, indicating the importance of associative learning processes. Finally, there is some evidence (mostly of anecdotal nature) that the circumstances immediately surrounding drug taking can modulate drug intake in ways that are not easily reducible to conditioning or stress. In the past few years some effort has been made to investigate this latter type of drug-environment interaction using animal models. Most importantly, we have recently shown that the context can modulate the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs independently of its physical characteristics. In these studies, some animals were transferred to the test cages immediately before the treatment (Non Resident group), whereas other animals were kept at all times in the test cages (Resident group). Some studies were conducted using a single drug, whereas others employed a polydrug taking procedure. In the present chapter, we will review not only the results obtained using this animal model but also those yielded by translational studies conducted in human addicts. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these findings for the study of drug addiction in humans and animals.},

This criterion has stood the passage of time despite major revisions of diagnostic systems, it is common to all known drugs of abuse and it can be readily and unambiguously operationalized in laboratory animals. Here I exhaustively review evidence showing that escalation to heavy consumption of different drugs (except perhaps nicotine) can be rapidly induced in the majority of individual animals (i.e., rats) by increased drug availability. Such an escalation of drug use is probably paralleled by an authentic escalation to drug addiction, as it is associated with the co-occurrence of other addiction-like changes (i.e., increased motivation for drug use; increased difficulty to abstain from drug use; decreased sensitivity to negative consequences). In addition, during escalation of drug intake, most individual animals become increasingly responsive to drug- and stress-primed, but apparently not cue-primed, reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction. Finally, following increased drug use, most individuals present selective cognitive dysfunctions (e.g., deficits in executive functions) that may contribute to the establishment and/or persistence of addiction. Thus, the study of individuals with escalating patterns of drug use should provide a unique and valid approach to investigate, experimentally, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the progression to addiction.},

Theoretical perspectives are given for the acquisition models indicating that the animal models are valid predictors of human ­behavior. Common organismic factors that contribute to the acquisition of drug abuse are also discussed, such as sex, hormonal influences, innate preference for sweet substances, impulsivity of choice, impaired inhibition, and avidity for physical activity. Differential rates of acquisition of drug {SA} in rats selectively bred for high and low sweet intake, ethanol intake, or avoidance responding are also discussed. Environmental factors such as enriched versus impoverished conditions, and the effect of behavioral economic factors related to drug abuse (e.g., effort, cost/reinforcement) are also considered. Pharmacological factors have also been found to influence acquisition, such as prenatal exposure to drugs, and potential treatment drug can reduce the rates of acquisition in animal models. Interrelations among factors are described, and their implications are summarized. This review adds to previous accounts of acquisition by shifting the emphasis from analysis of the process of acquisition of drug-taking to an assessment of the major factors that are influential in the initiation and acceleration of this process. The goal is to present translatable findings from animal research that are useful for informing prevention of drug abuse in humans.},

The technique may be used to derive angular approach coordinates for any angle in the coronal and/or sagittal planes. Once the coordinates are derived, they may be used with a single micromanipulator, as in the case of conventional placements.

Mice lacking this glucose reserve in muscle, heart, and several other tissues were generated by disruption of the {GYS}1 gene, which encodes an isoform of glycogen synthase. Crossing mice heterozygous for the {GYS}1 disruption resulted in a significant underrepresentation of {GYS}1-null mice in the offspring. Timed matings established that Mendelian inheritance was followed for up to 18.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and that ∼90\% of {GYS}1-null animals died soon after birth due to impaired cardiac function. Defects in cardiac development began between 11.5 and 14.5 dpc. At 18.5 dpc, the hearts were significantly smaller, with reduced ventricular chamber size and enlarged atria. Consistent with impaired cardiac function, edema, pooling of blood, and hemorrhagic liver were seen. Glycogen synthase and glycogen were undetectable in cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle from the surviving null mice, and the hearts showed normal morphology and function. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common birth defects in humans, at up to 1 in 50 live births. The results provide the first direct evidence that the ability to synthesize glycogen in cardiac muscle is critical for normal heart development and hence that its impairment could be a significant contributor to congenital heart defects.},

Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4–5 weeks.

These systems account for poor decision-making (i.e. prioritizing short-term consequences of a decisional option) leading to more elevated addiction risk and relapse.

	abstract = {Background
Changes in motivational processing may play a role in weight gain and other non-motor side effects in Parkinson's disease ({PD}) patients treated with deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.
Objective/hypothesis
We aimed to assess changes in aversive and appetitive motivational activation using modulation of the acoustic blink reflex ({ABR}) by rewarding and aversive stimuli.
Methods
{ABR} elicited during the viewing of erotic, food, aversive and neutral pictures was recorded in 11 off-medicated patients with the subthalamic stimulation switched {ON} and {OFF}, and in 11 control subjects.
Results
{ABR} to erotic stimuli was larger in patients in the {ON} compared to the {OFF} condition and controls (P \&lt; 0.01). Aversive stimuli caused a larger increase in the {ABR} in patients with the {ON} condition than in controls (P \&lt; 0.05). Additionally, we found a negative correlation of the {ABR} magnitude to food pictures in the {ON} condition with weight gain following subthalamic stimulation (P \&lt; 0.01, after adjustment to {OFF} condition).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that subthalamic stimulation affects motivational processing. Subthalamic stimulation may disturb appetitive engagement by erotic cues and increase aversive activation in {PD} patients. Additionally, postoperative weight gain may be related to changes in the processing of food cues due to subthalamic stimulation.},

This systematic review attempts to organize current {DBS} research into a series of unifying themes or issues such as whether the therapeutic effects are local or systems-wide or whether the effects are related to inhibition or excitation. A number of alternative hypotheses are offered for consideration including suppression of abnormal activity, striping basal ganglia output of misinformation, reduction of abnormal stochastic resonance effects due to increased noise in the disease state, and reinforcement of dynamic modulation of neuronal activity by resonance effects.},

Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) has proven to be a successful therapeutic approach in several patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Hitherto its application was mainly restricted to advanced disease patients resistant to medication or with severe treatment side effects. However, there is now growing interest in earlier application of {DBS}, aimed at improving clinical outcomes, quality of life, and avoiding psychosocial consequences of chronic disease-related impairments. We address the clinical and ethical aspects of two “early” uses of {DBS}, (1) {DBS} early in the course of the disease, and (2) {DBS} early in life (i.e. in children). Possible benefits, risks and burdens are discussed and thoroughly considered. Further research is needed to obtain a careful balance between exposing vulnerable patients to potential severe surgical risks and excluding them from a potentially good outcome.},

	abstract = {Background
Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) is routinely used as a treatment for treatment-refractory Parkinson's disease and has recently been proposed for psychiatric disorders such as Tourette syndrome ({TS}), obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}) and major depressive disorder ({MDD}). Although cognitive deterioration has repeatedly been shown in patients with Parkinson's disease following {DBS}, the impact of {DBS} on cognitive functioning in psychiatric patients has not yet been reviewed.
Objective
Reviewing the available literature on cognitive functioning following {DBS} in psychiatric patients.
Methods
A systematic literature search in {PubMed}, {EMBASE} and Web of Science, last updated in September 2012, found 1470 papers. Abstracts were scrutinized and 26 studies examining cognitive functioning of psychiatric patients following {DBS} were included on basis of predetermined inclusion criteria.
Results
Twenty-six studies reported cognitive functioning of 130 psychiatric patients following {DBS} (37 {TS} patients, 56 {OCD} patients, 28 {MDD} patients, 6 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 3 patients with other disorders). None of the studies reported substantial cognitive decline following {DBS}. On the contrary, 13 studies reported cognitive improvement following {DBS}.
Conclusion
Preliminary results suggest that {DBS} in psychiatric disorders does not lead to cognitive decline. In selected cases cognitive functioning was improved following {DBS}. However, cognitive improvement cannot be conclusively attributed to {DBS} since studies are hampered by serious limitations. We discuss the outcomes in light of these limitations and offer suggestions for future work.},

	abstract = {High frequency deep brain stimulation is an effective therapy for motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. However, the relative clinical efficacy of regular versus non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. To determine the temporal characteristics of non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation important for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, we compared the efficacy of temporally regular stimulation with four non-regular patterns of stimulation in subjects with Parkinson's disease using an alternating finger tapping task. The patterns of stimulation were also evaluated in a biophysical model of the parkinsonian basal ganglia that exhibited prominent oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range. The temporal patterns of stimulation differentially improved motor task performance. Three of the non-regular patterns of stimulation improved performance of the finger tapping task more than temporally regular stimulation. In the computational model all patterns of deep brain stimulation suppressed beta band oscillatory activity, and the degree of suppression was strongly correlated with the clinical efficacy across stimulation patterns. The three non-regular patterns of stimulation that improved motor performance over regular stimulation also suppressed beta band oscillatory activity in the computational model more effectively than regular stimulation. These data demonstrate that the temporal pattern of stimulation is an important consideration for the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, non-regular patterns of stimulation may ameliorate motor symptoms and suppress pathological rhythmic activity in the basal ganglia more effectively than regular stimulation. Therefore, non-regular patterns of deep brain stimulation may have useful clinical and experimental applications.},

Investigation of such interactions could benefit from closed-loop experimental protocols in which one stream can be controlled depending on the state of the other. We describe here methods to present rapid and precisely timed visual stimuli to awake animals, conditional on features of the animal's on-going brain state; those features are the presence, power and phase of oscillations in local field potentials ({LFP}). The system can process up to 64 channels in real time. We quantified its performance using simulations, synthetic data and animal experiments (chronic recordings in the dorsal cortex of awake turtles). The delay from detection of an oscillation to the onset of a visual stimulus on an {LCD} screen was 47.5 ms and visual-stimulus onset could be locked to the phase of ongoing oscillations at any frequency ≤40 Hz. Our software's architecture is flexible, allowing on-the-fly modifications by experimenters and the addition of new closed-loop control and analysis components through plugins.

Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce {HelioScan}, a software package written in {LabVIEW}, as a platform serving this dual role. {HelioScan} is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, {HelioScan} provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific {HelioScan} application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, {HelioScan} can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of {HelioScan} by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner.

Toward noninvasive imaging of brain activity through the hemodynamic response, the dark-field photoacoustic microscopy ({PAM}) technique was enhanced to image the cortex vasculature of the mouse brain in vivo using endogenous hemoglobin contrast. Specifically, the {PAM} system was redesigned to efficiently collect photoacoustic waves originating from cortical vessels, providing high (70 μm lateral and 54 μm axial) resolution images of the mouse brain vasculature with a contrast-to-noise ratio of 25 {dB}. These findings confirm the efficacy of {PAM} to noninvasively image vascular structures in the mouse brain and the potential to image mouse brain function by tracking the hemodynamic response.},

We report a scalable method to monolithically integrate microscopic light emitting diodes (μ{LEDs}) and recording sites onto silicon neural probes for optogenetic applications in neuroscience. Each μ{LED} and recording site has dimensions similar to a pyramidal neuron soma, providing confined emission and electrophysiological recording of action potentials and local field activity. We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12 μ{LEDs} and 32 recording sites, into the {CA}1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 {nW} light power, and fast population oscillations were induced at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells ∼50 μm apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

Here we provide a new design of a versatile reusable hybrid infusion-recording ({HIME}) system which can be utilized in freely moving mice performing cognitive tasks. The {HIME} system allows monitoring neuronal activity in multiple layers in several brain structures. Here, we provide examples of bilateral injection and recordings of full spectrum of learning and memory related oscillations, i.e., theta (4–12 Hz), gamma (40–100) and ripple activity (130–150 Hz), in five hippocampal layers as well as in the {CA}1 and {CA}2 regions. Furthermore, the system is designed to be used for parallel recordings in the amygdala, cortex and other brain areas, before and after infusion of reagents of interest, either in or off a cognitive test. We anticipate that the {HIME} system can be particularly convenient to advance functional neuroglycobiological studies and molecular deciphering of mechanisms governing long-term memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing a map of neuronal connectivity is a critical challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy ({EM}) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of {EM} allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification). In this manuscript we present the first fully-automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available in support of eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

	abstract = {Experimentally mapping synaptic connections, in terms of the numbers and locations of their synapses and estimating connection probabilities, is still not a tractable task, even for small volumes of tissue. In fact, the six layers of the neocortex contain thousands of unique types of synaptic connections between the many different types of neurons, of which only a handful have been characterized experimentally. Here we present a theoretical framework and a data-driven algorithmic strategy to digitally reconstruct the complete synaptic connectivity between the different types of neurons in a small well-defined volume of tissue—the micro-scale connectome of a neural microcircuit. By enforcing a set of established principles of synaptic connectivity, and leveraging interdependencies between fundamental properties of neural microcircuits to constrain the reconstructed connectivity, the algorithm yields three parameters per connection type that predict the anatomy of all types of biologically viable synaptic connections. The predictions reproduce a spectrum of experimental data on synaptic connectivity not used by the algorithm. We conclude that an algorithmic approach to the connectome can serve as a tool to accelerate experimental mapping, indicating the minimal dataset required to make useful predictions, identifying the datasets required to improve their accuracy, testing the feasibility of experimental measurements, and making it possible to test hypotheses of synaptic connectivity.},

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) detects regional signals, based on which we could infer the direct or indirect neuronal connectivity between the regions.

A maximum likelihood ({ML}) discrepancy function is minimized against some constrained coefficients of a path model. The minimization is an iterative process. The computing time is very long as the number of iterations increases geometrically with the number of path coefficients. Using regular Quad-Core Central Processing Unit ({CPU}) platform, duration up to 3 months is required for the iterations from 0 to 30 path coefficients. This study demonstrates the application of Graphical Processing Unit ({GPU}) with the parallel Genetic Algorithm ({GA}) that replaces the Powell minimization in the standard program code of the analysis software package.

Web application technologies and standards such as {RESTful} webservices, {HTML}5 and high-performance in-browser {JavaScript} engines are being utilized to vastly improve the way that the world accesses and shares information. The neuroscience community can also benefit tremendously from these technologies. We present here a web application that allows users to explore and request the complex datasets that need to be shared among the neuroimaging community. The {COINS} (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite) Data Exchange uses web application technologies to facilitate data sharing in three phases: Exploration, Request/Communication, and Download. This paper will focus on the first phase, and how intuitive exploration of large and complex datasets is achieved using a framework that centers around asynchronous client-server communication ({AJAX}) and also exposes a powerful {API} that can be utilized by other applications to explore available data.

However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the “open {metaData} Markup Language” ({odML}), for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In {odML} arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key–value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to {odML} is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes {odML} flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in {odML}-terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the {odML} format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of {odML} also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

However, incompatible data models and file formats make it difficult to exchange data between these tools. This reduces scientific productivity, renders potentially useful analysis methods inaccessible and impedes collaboration between labs. A common representation of the core data would improve interoperability and facilitate data-sharing. To that end, we propose here a language-independent object model, named “Neo,” suitable for representing data acquired from electroencephalographic, intracellular, or extracellular recordings, or generated from simulations. As a concrete instantiation of this object model we have developed an open source implementation in the Python programming language. In addition to representing electrophysiology data in memory for the purposes of analysis and visualization, the Python implementation provides a set of input/output ({IO}) modules for reading/writing the data from/to a variety of commonly used file formats. Support is included for formats produced by most of the major manufacturers of electrophysiology recording equipment and also for more generic formats such as {MATLAB}. Data representation and data analysis are conceptually separate: it is easier to write robust analysis code if it is focused on analysis and relies on an underlying package to handle data representation. For that reason, and also to be as lightweight as possible, the Neo object model and the associated Python package are deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for data analysis or visualization. Software for neurophysiology data analysis and visualization built on top of Neo automatically gains the benefits of interoperability, easier data sharing and automatic format conversion; there is already a burgeoning ecosystem of such tools. We intend that Neo should become the standard basis for Python tools in neurophysiology.},

	abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) image analysis techniques provide a powerful means to rapidly and accurately assess complex morphological and functional interactions between neural cells. Current software-based identification methods of neural cells generally fall into two applications: (1) segmentation of cell nuclei in high-density constructs or (2) tracing of cell neurites in single cell investigations. We have developed novel methodologies to permit the systematic identification of populations of neuronal somata possessing rich morphological detail and dense neurite arborization throughout thick tissue or 3-D in vitro constructs. The image analysis incorporates several novel automated features for the discrimination of neurites and somata by initially classifying features in 2-D and merging these classifications into 3-D objects; the 3-D reconstructions automatically identify and adjust for over and under segmentation errors. Additionally, the platform provides for software-assisted error corrections to further minimize error. These features attain very accurate cell boundary identifications to handle a wide range of morphological complexities. We validated these tools using confocal z-stacks from thick 3-D neural constructs where neuronal somata had varying degrees of neurite arborization and complexity, achieving an accuracy of ≥95\%. We demonstrated the robustness of these algorithms in a more complex arena through the automated segmentation of neural cells in ex vivo brain slices. These novel methods surpass previous techniques by improving the robustness and accuracy by: (1) the ability to process neurites and somata, (2) bidirectional segmentation correction, and (3) validation via software-assisted user input. This 3-D image analysis platform provides valuable tools for the unbiased analysis of neural tissue or tissue surrogates within a 3-D context, appropriate for the study of multi-dimensional cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.},

Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture ({EDC}) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The {INCF} Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of “primary states” is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit “criticality,” i.e., the property of being poised at a “critical” point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network ({DMN}) and a decoupling between the {DMN} and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

Nevertheless, despite several explicit implementations, the integration of first-person data into the experimental protocols of cognitive neuroscience still faces a number of epistemological and methodological challenges. Notably, the difficulties to simultaneously acquire phenomenological and neuroscientific data have limited its implementation into research projects. In our paper, we propose that neurofeedback paradigms, in which subjects learn to self-regulate their own neural activity, may offer a pragmatic way to integrate first-person and third-person descriptions. Here, information from first- and third-person perspectives is braided together in the iterative causal closed loop, creating experimental situations in which they reciprocally constrain each other. In real-time, the subject is not only actively involved in the process of data acquisition, but also assisted to directly influence the neural data through conscious experience. Thus, neurofeedback may help to gain a deeper phenomenological-physiological understanding of downward causations whereby conscious activities have direct causal effects on neuronal patterns. We discuss possible mechanisms that could mediate such effects and indicate a number of directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Neurofeedback ({NFB}) is emerging as a promising technique that enables self-regulation of ongoing brain oscillations. However, despite a rise in empirical evidence attesting to its clinical benefits, a solid theoretical basis is still lacking on the manner in which {NFB} is able to achieve these outcomes. The present work attempts to bring together various concepts from neurobiology, engineering, and dynamical systems so as to propose a contemporary theoretical framework for the mechanistic effects of {NFB}. The objective is to provide a firmly neurophysiological account of {NFB}, which goes beyond traditional behaviorist interpretations that attempt to explain psychological processes solely from a descriptive standpoint whilst treating the brain as a “black box”. To this end, we interlink evidence from experimental findings that encompass a broad range of intrinsic brain phenomena: starting from “bottom-up” mechanisms of neural synchronization, followed by “top-down” regulation of internal brain states, moving to dynamical systems plus control-theoretic principles, and concluding with activity-dependent as well as homeostatic forms of brain plasticity. In support of our framework, we examine the effects of {NFB} in several brain disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity ({ADHD}) and post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). In sum, it is argued that pathological oscillations emerge from an abnormal formation of brain-state attractor landscape(s). The central thesis put forward is that {NFB} tunes brain oscillations toward a homeostatic set-point which affords an optimal balance between network flexibility and stability (i.e., self-organised criticality ({SOC})).},

	abstract = {Many experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that the reliable propagation of synchronous neural activity is crucial for neural information processing. The propagation of synchronous firing activity in so-called synfire chains has been studied extensively in feed-forward networks of spiking neurons. However, it remains unclear how such neural activity could emerge in recurrent neuronal networks through synaptic plasticity. In this study, we investigate whether local excitation, i.e., neurons that fire at a higher frequency than the other, spontaneously active neurons in the network, can shape a network to allow for synchronous activity propagation. We use two-dimensional, locally connected and heterogeneous neuronal networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity ({STDP}). We find that, in our model, local excitation drives profound network changes within seconds. In the emergent network, neural activity propagates synchronously through the network. This activity originates from the site of the local excitation and propagates through the network. The synchronous activity propagation persists, even when the local excitation is removed, since it derives from the synaptic weight matrix. Importantly, once this connectivity is established it remains stable even in the presence of spontaneous activity. Our results suggest that synfire-chain-like activity can emerge in a relatively simple way in realistic neural networks by locally exciting the desired origin of the neuronal sequence.},

Our results reveal that the same neural mass network may process different combinations of dynamical inputs as different logical operations or combinations of them. This dynamical feature of the network allows it to process complex inputs in a very sophisticated manner. The results are reproduced experimentally with electronic circuits of coupled Chua oscillators, showing the robustness of this kind of computation to the intrinsic noise and parameter mismatch of the coupled oscillators.

	abstract = {To learn and mimic how the brain processes information has been a major research challenge for decades. Despite the efforts, little is known on how we encode, maintain and retrieve information. One of the hypothesis assumes that transient states are generated in our intricate network of neurons when the brain is stimulated by a sensory input. Based on this idea, powerful computational schemes have been developed. These schemes, known as machine-learning techniques, include artificial neural networks, support vector machine and reservoir computing, among others. In this paper, we concentrate on the reservoir computing ({RC}) technique using delay-coupled systems. Unlike traditional {RC}, where the information is processed in large recurrent networks of interconnected artificial neurons, we choose a minimal design, implemented via a simple nonlinear dynamical system subject to a self-feedback loop with delay. This design is not intended to represent an actual brain circuit, but aims at finding the minimum ingredients that allow developing an efficient information processor. This simple scheme not only allows us to address fundamental questions but also permits simple hardware implementations. By reducing the neuro-inspired reservoir computing approach to its bare essentials, we find that nonlinear transient responses of the simple dynamical system enable the processing of information with excellent performance and at unprecedented speed. We specifically explore different hardware implementations and, by that, we learn about the role of nonlinearity, noise, system responses, connectivity structure, and the quality of projection onto the required high-dimensional state space. Besides the relevance for the understanding of basic mechanisms, this scheme opens direct technological opportunities that could not be addressed with previous approaches.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that {CMOS} devices whose behavior is rendered probabilistic by noise (yielding probabilistic {CMOS} or {PCMOS}) can be harnessed for ultra low energy and high performance computation. {PCMOS} devices are inherently probabilistic in that they are guaranteed to compute correctly with a probability 1/2 {\textless} p {\textless} 1 and thus, by design, they are expected to compute incorrectly with a probability (1 - p). In this paper, we show that {PCMOS} technology yields significant improvements, both in the energy consumed as well as in the performance, for probabilistic applications with broad utility. These benefits are derived using an application-architecture-technology (A2T) co-design methodology introduced here, yielding an entirely novel family of probabilistic system-on-a-chip ({PSOC}) architectures. All of our application and architectural savings are quantified using the product of the energy and the performance denoted (energy x performance): the {PCMOS} based gains are as high as a substantial multiplicative factor of over 560 when compared to a competing energy-efficient {CMOS} based realization.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Needle-based biopsy and local therapy of prostate cancer depend multimodal imaging for both target planning and needle guidance. The clinical process involves selection of target locations in a pre-operative image volume and registering these to an intra-operative volume. Registration inaccuracies inevitably lead to targeting error, a major clinical concern. The analysis of targeting error requires a large number of images with known ground truth, which has been infeasible even for the largest research centers.

Methods
We propose to generate realistic prostate imaging data in a controllable way, with known ground truth, by simulation of prostate size, shape, motion and deformation typically encountered in prostatic needle placement. This data is then used to evaluate a given registration algorithm, by testing its ability to reproduce ground truth contours, motions and deformations. The method builds on statistical shape atlas to generate large number of realistic prostate shapes and finite element modeling to generate high-fidelity deformations, while segmentation error is simulated by warping the ground truth data in specific prostate regions. Expected target registration error ({TRE}) is computed as a vector field.

Results
The simulator was configured to evaluate the {TRE} when using a surface-based rigid registration algorithm in a typical prostate biopsy targeting scenario. Simulator parameters, such as segmentation error and deformation, were determined by measurements in clinical images. Turnaround time for the full simulation of one test case was below 3 minutes. The simulator is customizable for testing, comparing, optimizing segmentation and registration methods and is independent of the imaging modalities used.},

With increasing research on system integration for image-guided therapy ({IGT}), there has been a strong demand for standardized communication among devices and software to share data such as target positions, images and device status.

Method
We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network communication protocol for {IGT}, named {OpenIGTLink}, to transfer transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering scenarios.

Results
The protocol was able to transfer position data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with latency of {\textless}10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated that the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and software.

Conclusion
The protocol proved capable of handling data required in the {IGT} setting with sufficient time resolution and latency. The protocol not only improves the interoperability of devices and software but also promotes transitions of research prototypes to clinical applications..},

Several behavioral features—such as turning responses to whole-field motion and dark avoidance—are well-replicated in this virtual setting. We readily observed neuronal populations in the hindbrain with laterally selective responses that correlated with right or left optomotor behavior. We also observed neurons in the habenula, pallium, and midbrain with response properties specific to environmental features. Beyond single-cell correlations, the classification of network activity in such virtual settings promises to reveal principles of brainwide neural dynamics during behavior.},

Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity of each neuron from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. The matrix factorization approach relies on the observation that the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity can be expressed as a product of two matrices: a spatial matrix that encodes the location of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. We present a simple approach for estimating the dynamics of the calcium indicator as well as the observation noise statistics from the observed data. These parameters are then used to set up the matrix factorization problem in a constrained form that requires no further parameter tuning. We discuss initialization and post-processing techniques that enhance the performance of our method, along with efficient and largely parallelizable algorithms. We apply our method to \{{\textbackslash}it in vivo\} large scale multi-neuronal imaging data and also demonstrate how similar methods can be used for the analysis of \{{\textbackslash}it in vivo\} dendritic imaging data.},

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging {\textgreater}100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

	abstract = {Dynamic languages have become popular for scientific computing. They are generally considered highly productive, but lacking in performance. This paper presents Julia, a new dynamic language for technical computing, designed for performance from the beginning by adapting and extending modern programming language techniques. A design based on generic functions and a rich type system simultaneously enables an expressive programming model and successful type inference, leading to good performance for a wide range of programs. This makes it possible for much of the Julia library to be written in Julia itself, while also incorporating best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries.},

	abstract = {The Free-Form Deformation ({FFD}) algorithm is a widely used method for non-rigid registration. Modifications have previously been proposed to ensure topology preservation and invertibility within this framework. However, in practice, none of these yield the inverse transformation itself, and one loses the parsimonious B-spline parametrisation. We present a novel log-Euclidean {FFD} approach in which a spline model of a stationary velocity field is exponentiated to yield a diffeomorphism, using an efficient scaling-and-squaring algorithm. The log-Euclidean framework allows easy computation of a consistent inverse transformation, and offers advantages in group-wise atlas building and statistical analysis. We optimise the Normalised Mutual Information plus a regularisation term based on the Jacobian determinant of the transformation, and we present a novel analytical gradient of the latter. The proposed method has been assessed against a fast {FFD} implementation (F3D) using simulated T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance brain images. The overlap measures between propagated grey matter tissue probability maps used in the simulations show similar results for both approaches; however, our new method obtains more reasonable Jacobian values, and yields inverse transformations.},

In cerebellar folium crus {IIa} of anesthetized rats, we imaged the labeled molecular layer and identified all major cellular structures: Purkinje cells, interneurons, parallel fibers, and Bergmann glia. Using extracellular stimuli we evoked calcium transients corresponding to parallel fiber beam activity. This beam activity triggered prolonged calcium transients in interneurons, consistent with in vitro evidence for synaptic activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors via glutamate spillover. We also observed spontaneous calcium transients in Purkinje cell dendrites that were identified as climbing-fiber-evoked calcium spikes by their size, time course, and sensitivity to {AMPA} receptor antagonist. Two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-loaded cerebellar cortex is thus well suited to optically monitor synaptic processing in the intact cerebellum.},

The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging},

A spatial light modulator allows tens of user-selected neurons to be targeted for spatiotemporally precise concurrent optogenetic activation, while simultaneous fast calcium imaging provides high-resolution network-wide readout of the manipulation with negligible optical cross-talk. Proof-of-principle experiments in mouse barrel cortex demonstrate interrogation of the same neuronal population during different behavioral states and targeting of neuronal ensembles based on their functional signature.

Correlating patterned neuronal activity to defined animal behaviors is a core goal in neuroscience. Optogenetics is one large step toward achieving this goal, yet optical methods to control neural activity in behaving rodents have so far been limited to perturbing all light-sensitive neurons in a large volume. Here we demonstrate an all-optical method for precise spatial control and recording of neuronal activity in anesthetized and awake freely behaving mice. Photoactivation patterns targeted to multiple neuronal somata, produced with computer-generated holography, were transmitted to the mouse brain using a micro-objective-coupled fiber bundle. Fluorescence imaging through the same device, via epifluorescence, structured illumination, or scanless multipoint confocal microscopy, allowed imaging of neurons and recording of neuronal activity. The fiberscope was tested in mice coexpressing {ChR}2-{tdTomato} and {GCaMP}5-G in cerebellar interneurons, delivering near-cellular resolution photoactivation in freely behaving mice.},

The root of our brain's computational power lies in its trillions of connections. With our increasing ability to study these connections experimentally comes the need for analytical tools that can be used to develop meaningful quantitative characterizations. In this manuscript, we present a new such tool, incremental mutual information ({IMI}), that enables the characterization of the strength and dynamics of the connection between a pair of neurons based on the statistical dependencies in their spiking activity. {IMI} is an important step forward from existing approaches, as it has the potential to disambiguate dependencies due to the connection between two neurons from those due to other sources, such as shared external inputs, provided that the dependencies have appropriate timescales. We demonstrate the utility of {IMI} through the analysis of simulated neuronal activity as well as activity recorded in the primate visual system.},

	abstract = {Commercially available data acquisition systems for multielectrode recording from freely moving animals are expensive, often rely on proprietary software, and do not provide detailed, modifiable circuit schematics. When used in conjunction with electrical stimulation, they are prone to prolonged, saturating stimulation artifacts that prevent the recording of short-latency evoked responses. Yet electrical stimulation is integral to many experimental designs, and critical for emerging brain-computer interfacing and neuroprosthetic applications. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use, modifiable, and inexpensive system for multielectrode neural recording and stimulation. Setup costs are less than {US}\$10,000 for 64 channels, an order of magnitude lower than comparable commercial systems. Unlike commercial equipment, the system recovers rapidly from stimulation and allows short-latency action potentials ({\textless}1 ms post-stimulus) to be detected, facilitating closed-loop applications and exposing neural activity that would otherwise remain hidden. To illustrate this capability, evoked activity from microstimulation of the rodent hippocampus is presented. System noise levels are similar to existing platforms, and extracellular action potentials and local field potentials can be recorded simultaneously. The system is modular, in banks of 16 channels, and flexible in usage: while primarily designed for in vivo use, it can be combined with commercial preamplifiers to record from in vitro multielectrode arrays. The system’s open-source control software, {NeuroRighter}, is implemented in C\#, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. As C\# functions in a managed code environment, which may impact performance, analysis was conducted to ensure comparable speed to C++ for this application. Hardware schematics, layout files, and software are freely available. Since maintaining wired headstage connections with freely moving animals is difficult, we describe a new method of electrode-headstage coupling using neodymium magnets.},

Unlike severe T-cell immunodeficiencies, however, partial immunodeficiencies are commonly associated with hyper-immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases and elevated {IgE} production. This causative association is counter-intuitive — immune deficiencies are caused by loss-of-function changes to the T-cell component, whereas the coincident autoimmune symptoms are the consequence of gain-of-function changes. This Review details the genetic basis of partial T -cell immunodeficiencies and draws on recent advances in mouse models to propose mechanisms by which a reduction in T-cell numbers or function may disturb the population-dependent balance between activation and tolerance.},

This technique allows real-time assessment of tissue which may improve diagnostic yield by guiding biopsy. Research and development continues to reduce the overall size of the imaging probe, increase the image acquisition speed, and improve resolution and field of view of confocal endomicroscopes. Technical advances will continue to enable application to less accessible organs and more complex systems in the body. Lateral and axial resolutions down to 0.5 and 3 μm, respectively, field of view as large as 800 × 450 μm, and objective lens and total probe outer diameters down to 0.35 and 1.25 mm, respectively, have been achieved.

	abstract = {Epithelial cancers account for substantial mortality and are an important public health concern. With the need for earlier detection and treatment of these malignancies, the ability to accurately detect precancerous lesions has an increasingly important role in controlling cancer incidence and mortality. New optical technologies are capable of identifying early pathology in tissues or organs in which cancer is known to develop through stages of dysplasia, including the esophagus, colon, pancreas, liver, bladder, and cervix. These diagnostic imaging advances, together as a field known as optical endomicroscopy, are based on confocal microscopy, spectroscopy-based imaging, and optical coherence tomography ({OCT}), and function as "optical biopsies," enabling tissue pathology to be imaged in situ and in real time without the need to excise and process specimens as in conventional biopsy and histopathology. Optical biopsy techniques can acquire high-resolution, cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale through the use of endoscopes, catheters, laparoscopes, and needles. Since the inception of these technologies, dramatic technological advances in accuracy, speed, and functionality have been realized. The current paradigm of optical biopsy, or single-area, point-based images, is slowly shifting to more comprehensive microscopy of larger tracts of mucosa. With the development of Fourier-domain {OCT}, also known as optical frequency domain imaging or, more recently, volumetric laser endomicroscopy, comprehensive surveillance of the entire distal esophagus is now achievable at speeds that were not possible with conventional {OCT} technologies. Optical diagnostic technologies are emerging as clinically useful tools with the potential to set a new standard for real-time diagnosis. New imaging techniques enable visualization of high-resolution, cross-sectional images and offer the opportunity to guide biopsy, allowing maximal diagnostic yields and appropriate staging without the limitations and risks inherent with current random biopsy protocols. However, the ability of these techniques to achieve widespread adoption in clinical practice depends on future research designed to improve accuracy and allow real-time data transmission and storage, thereby linking pathology to the treating physician. These imaging advances are expected to eventually offer a see-and-treat paradigm, leading to improved patient care and potential cost reduction.

	abstract = {High-resolution microendoscopy ({HRME}) uses epi-fluorescence imaging with a coherent fiber-optic bundle to enable in vivo examination of cellular morphology. While the {HRME} platform has recently gained popularity as a simple alternative to confocal endomicroscopy, the axial response of {HRME} in thick, scattering tissue has yet to be described quantitatively. These details are important because when analyzing images collected by {HRME}, out-of-focus light may affect the accuracy of quantitative parameters such as nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio, which has been proposed as a diagnostic indicator of dysplasia or cancer. In this study we investigated the imaging properties of the {HRME} system by using phantoms simulating scattering tissue with fluorescently labeled nuclei. We directly compared {HRME} imaging with confocal endomicroscopy in phantoms and in vivo human tissue. {HRME} images defocused (deep) objects with apparent diameters and intensity levels that are in agreement with a simple geometric model. Out-of-focus nuclei contribute a relatively low, uniform background level to images which neither leads to the erroneous appearance of large nuclei from deep layers, nor prevents accurate imaging of superficial nuclei with high contrast.},

The individual significance of each of these correlated components cannot be established without observing the full behavior. Recently, Wesson [1] concluded that rats display their submissive status by lowering sniff rate following face-to-face encounters with a dominant conspecific. How rats can perceive such changes in sniff rate is unclear. We recorded sniffing and vocal production of rats during social interactions. Face-to-face encounters with a dominant rat immediately elicited 22 {kHz} alarm calls in the submissive. The large drop in sniff rate observed in submissive rats was caused by the prolonged exhalations needed to produce these calls. We propose that, while submissive rats do lower sniffing rates around face-to-face encounters, dominant rats need not directly perceive this change, but may instead attend to the salient 22 {kHz} alarm calls.},

	abstract = {Objective. Maintenance of cognitive control is a major concern for many human disease conditions; therefore, a major goal of human neuroprosthetics is to facilitate and/or recover the cognitive function when such circumstances impair appropriate decision making. Approach. Minicolumnar activity from the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) was recorded from nonhuman primates trained to perform a delayed match to sample ({DMS}), via custom-designed conformal multielectrode arrays that provided inter-laminar recordings from neurons in the {PFC} layer 2/3 and layer 5. Such recordings were analyzed via a previously demonstrated nonlinear multi-input–multi-output ({MIMO}) neuroprosthesis in rodents, which extracted and characterized multicolumnar firing patterns during {DMS} performance. Main results. The {MIMO} model verified that the conformal recorded individual {PFC} minicolumns responded to entrained target selections in patterns critical for successful {DMS} performance. This allowed the substitution of task-related layer 5 neuron firing patterns with electrical stimulation in the same recording regions during columnar transmission from layer 2/3 at the time of target selection. Such stimulation improved normal task performance, but more importantly, recovered performance when applied as a neuroprosthesis following the pharmacological disruption of decision making in the same task. Significance. These findings provide the first successful application of neuroprosthesis in the primate brain designed specifically to restore or repair the disrupted cognitive function.},

	abstract = {Objective. Inferring the times of sequences of action potentials ({APs}) (spike trains) from neurophysiological data is a key problem in computational neuroscience. The detection of {APs} from two-photon imaging of calcium signals offers certain advantages over traditional electrophysiological approaches, as up to thousands of spatially and immunohistochemically defined neurons can be recorded simultaneously. However, due to noise, dye buffering and the limited sampling rates in common microscopy configurations, accurate detection of {APs} from calcium time series has proved to be a difficult problem. Approach. Here we introduce a novel approach to the problem making use of finite rate of innovation ({FRI}) theory (Vetterli et al 2002 {IEEE} Trans. Signal Process. 50 1417–28). For calcium transients well fit by a single exponential, the problem is reduced to reconstructing a stream of decaying exponentials. Signals made of a combination of exponentially decaying functions with different onset times are a subclass of {FRI} signals, for which much theory has recently been developed by the signal processing community. Main results. We demonstrate for the first time the use of {FRI} theory to retrieve the timing of {APs} from calcium transient time series. The final algorithm is fast, non-iterative and parallelizable. Spike inference can be performed in real-time for a population of neurons and does not require any training phase or learning to initialize parameters. Significance. The algorithm has been tested with both real data (obtained by simultaneous electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging of calcium signals in cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites), and surrogate data, and outperforms several recently proposed methods for spike train inference from calcium imaging data.},

To demonstrate the utility of this algorithm under experimental conditions, we evaluate its performance in decoding both population spike trains and calcium signals with different correlation structures.

Many investigators implant electrode arrays in multiple brain areas and record from chronically implanted electrodes over time to answer a variety of questions. Technical challenges related to analyzing large-scale neuronal recording data are not trivial. Several analysis methods traditionally used by neurophysiologists do not account for dependencies in the data that are inherent in multi-electrode recordings. In addition, when neurophysiological data are not best modeled by the normal distribution and when the variables of interest may not be linearly related, extensions of the linear modeling techniques are recommended. A variety of methods exist to analyze correlated data, even when the data are not normally distributed and the relationships are nonlinear. Here we review expansions of the Generalized Linear Model designed to address these data properties. Such methods are used in other research fields, and the application to large-scale neuronal recording data will enable investigators to determine the variable properties that convincingly contribute to the variances in the observed neuronal measures. Standard measures of neuron properties such as response magnitudes can be analyzed using these methods, and measures of neuronal network activity such as spike timing correlations can be analyzed as well. We have done just that in recordings from 100-electrode arrays implanted in the primary somatosensory cortex of owl monkeys. Here we illustrate how one example method, Generalized Estimating Equations analysis, is a useful method to apply to large-scale neuronal recordings.},

The {PRC} is useful to predict synchronized dynamics of neurons; hence, its measurement from experimental data attracts increasing interest in neural science. This paper introduces a Bayesian method for estimating {PRCs} from data, which allows for the correlation of errors in explanatory and response variables of the {PRC}. The method is implemented with a replica exchange Monte Carlo technique; this avoids local minima and enables efficient calculation of posterior averages. A test with artificial data generated by the noisy Morris–Lecar equation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional regression that ignores errors in the explanatory variable. Experimental data from the pyramidal cells in the rat motor cortex is also analyzed with the method; a case is found where the result with the proposed method is considerably different from that obtained by conventional regression.},

	abstract = {Spiking neuron models have advanced to the stage of accurately predicting the spike times of individual biological neurons for given fluctuating current. Most of the successful models are based on deterministic mechanistic modeling. In order to describe the stochastic aspect of neuronal firing, I propose setting a deterministic model in a stochastic framework, namely, incorporating the multi-timescale adaptive threshold ({MAT}) model of neuronal spiking into the stochastic framework of the linear–nonlinear Poisson ({LNP}) model in the form of a generalized linear model ({GLM}). In this setting, the probability of spike occurrence is updated each time a spike is derived from the past probability. Accordingly, the model may account for nontrivial firing patterns of various neurons that cannot be realized with the inhomogeneous Poisson process. The stochastic {MAT} model is not only capable of characterizing firing mechanisms specific to individual neurons, but may render the statistical inference feasible for the underlying mechanisms from the data. I also examine here two plausible principles for adjusting the model parameters: maximizing the spike time coincidence between the model and data, and maximizing the likelihood. It is found that these principles bring about greatly different characteristics for an identical set of data.},

	abstract = {In many pattern classification/recognition applications of artificial neural networks, an object to be classified is represented by a fixed sized 2-dimensional array of uniform type, which corresponds to the cells of a 2-dimensional grid of the same size. A general neural network structure, called an undistricted neural network, which takes all the elements in the array as inputs could be used for problems such as these. However, a districted neural network can be used to reduce the training complexity. A districted neural network usually consists of two levels of sub-neural networks. Each of the lower level neural networks, called a regional sub-neural network, takes the elements in a region of the array as its inputs and is expected to output a temporary class label, called an individual opinion, based on the partial information of the entire array. The higher level neural network, called an assembling sub-neural network, uses the outputs (opinions) of regional sub-neural networks as inputs, and by consensus derives the label decision for the object. Each of the sub-neural networks can be trained separately and thus the training is less expensive. The regional sub-neural networks can be trained and performed in parallel and independently, therefore a high speed can be achieved. We prove theoretically in this paper, using a simple model, that a districted neural network is actually more stable than an undistricted neural network in noisy environments. We conjecture that the result is valid for all neural networks. This theory is verified by experiments involving gender classification and human face recognition. We conclude that a districted neural network is highly recommended for neural network applications in recognition or classification of 2-dimensional array patterns in highly noisy environments.},

Here, we review an information-theoretic approach to population coding. We first discuss how to compute the information carried by simultaneously recorded neural populations, and in particular how to reduce the limited sampling bias which affects the calculation of information from a limited amount of experimental data. We then discuss how to quantify the contribution of individual members of the population, or the interaction between them, to the overall information encoded by the considered group of neurons. We focus in particular on evaluating what is the contribution of interactions up to any given order to the total information. We illustrate this formalism with applications to simulated data with realistic neuronal statistics and to real simultaneous recordings of multiple spike trains.},

	abstract = {The encoding of sensory information by populations of cortical neurons forms the basis for perception but remains poorly understood. To understand the constraints of cortical population coding we analyzed neural responses to natural sounds recorded in auditory cortex of primates (Macaca mulatta). We estimated stimulus information while varying the composition and size of the considered population. Consistent with previous reports we found that when choosing subpopulations randomly from the recorded ensemble, the average population information increases steadily with population size. This scaling was explained by a model assuming that each neuron carried equal amounts of information, and that any overlap between the information carried by each neuron arises purely from random sampling within the stimulus space. However, when studying subpopulations selected to optimize information for each given population size, the scaling of information was strikingly different: a small fraction of temporally precise cells carried the vast majority of information. This scaling could be explained by an extended model, assuming that the amount of information carried by individual neurons was highly nonuniform, with few neurons carrying large amounts of information. Importantly, these optimal populations can be determined by a single biophysical marker—the neuron's encoding time scale—allowing their detection and readout within biologically realistic circuits. These results show that extrapolations of population information based on random ensembles may overestimate the population size required for stimulus encoding, and that sensory cortical circuits may process information using small but highly informative ensembles.},

	abstract = {The rodent whisker-associated thalamic nucleus ({VPM}) contains a somatotopic map where whisker representation is divided into distinct neuronal sub-populations, called 'barreloids'. Each barreloid projects to its associated cortical barrel column and so forms a gateway for incoming sensory stimuli to the barrel cortex. We aimed to determine how the population of neurons within one barreloid encodes naturalistic whisker motion. In rats, we recorded the extracellular activity of up to 9 single neurons within a single barreloid, by implanting silicon probes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the barreloids. We found that play-back of texture-induced whisker motion evoked sparse responses, timed with millisecond precision. At the population level, there was synchronous activity: however, different subsets of neurons were synchronously active at different times. Mutual information between population responses and whisker motion increased near linearly with population size. When normalised to factor out firing rate differences, we found that texture was encoded with greater informational-efficiency than white noise. These results indicate that, within each {VPM} barreloid, there is a rich and efficient population code for naturalistic whisker motion based on precisely timed, population spike patterns.},

A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to {MEG} planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked {EEG} responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/{EEG} signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

Such interactions are quantified as redundancy (overlapping information content) and synergy (joint information not available in the individual responses). Conceptually, this is similar to methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis or the cross-classification decoding technique, which quantify the similarity of stimulus representation in different neural responses (but cannot address synergistic effects). However, the information theoretic approach can be applied with a wider range of experimental designs, and to univariate responses, which allows mapping of representational interactions with the full spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded signals. By combining the Gaussian copula mutual information estimator and the information theoretic approach to quantifying representational interactions within the Wiener-Granger framework for causal inference, we have developed an approach to measuring functional connectivity that is grounded in specific stimulus information content. We have demonstrated within-subject cross-hemisphere communication of information about eye visibility in a face detection task (Ince et al., 2016b) using sensor space {EEG} data. We have also developed Directed Feature Information ({DFI}), a novel measure of directed functional connectivity which quantifies communication about the specific stimulus features subtending perceptual decisions (Ince et al., 2015). These developments allow for network level analyses of functional neuroimaging data that are directly grounded in the representation, processing and communication of specific stimulus features, and so provide the promise of a new perspective on the algorithmic basis of many cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

	abstract = {The problem of how to properly quantify redundant information is an open question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to two or more predictor variables Xi. It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the Xi. We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition ({PID}) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

	abstract = {Information theoretic measures can be used to identify nonlinear interactions between source and target variables through reductions in uncertainty. In information partitioning, multivariate mutual information is decomposed into synergistic, unique, and redundant components. Synergy is information shared only when sources influence a target together, uniqueness is information only provided by one source, and redundancy is overlapping shared information from multiple sources. While this partitioning has been applied to provide insights into complex dependencies, several proposed partitioning methods overestimate redundant information and omit a component of unique information because they do not account for source dependencies. Additionally, information partitioning has only been applied to time-series data in a limited context, using basic pdf estimation techniques or a Gaussian assumption. We develop a Rescaled Redundancy measure (Rs) to solve the source dependency issue, and present Gaussian, autoregressive, and chaotic test cases to demonstrate its advantages over existing techniques in the presence of noise, various source correlations, and different types of interactions. This study constitutes the first rigorous application of information partitioning to environmental time-series data, and addresses how noise, pdf estimation technique, or source dependencies can influence detected measures. We illustrate how our techniques can unravel the complex nature of forcing and feedback within an ecohydrologic system with an application to 1 min environmental signals of air temperature, relative humidity, and windspeed. The methods presented here are applicable to the study of a broad range of complex systems composed of interacting variables.},

	abstract = {Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging ({DKI}) provides quantifiable information on the non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion in biological tissue. Changes in water diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) parameters and {DKI} parameters in several white and gray matter regions were investigated in a mild controlled cortical impact ({CCI}) injury rat model at both the acute (2h) and the sub-acute (7days) stages following injury. Mixed model {ANOVA} analysis revealed significant changes in temporal patterns of both {DTI} and {DKI} parameters in the cortex, hippocampus, external capsule and corpus callosum. Post-hoc tests indicated acute changes in mean diffusivity ({MD}) in the bilateral cortex and hippocampus (p{\textless}0.0005) and fractional anisotropy ({FA}) in ipsilateral cortex (p{\textless}0.0005), hippocampus (p=0.014), corpus callosum (p=0.031) and contralateral external capsule (p=0.011). These changes returned to baseline by the sub-acute stage. However, mean kurtosis ({MK}) was significantly elevated at the sub-acute stages in all ipsilateral regions and scaled inversely with the distance from the impacted site (cortex and corpus callosum: p{\textless}0.0005; external capsule: p=0.003; hippocampus: p=0.011). Further, at the sub-acute stage increased {MK} was also observed in the contralateral regions compared to baseline (cortex: p=0.032; hippocampus: p=0.039) while no change was observed with {MD} and {FA}. An increase in mean kurtosis was associated with increased reactive astrogliosis from immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results suggest that {DKI} is sensitive to microstructural changes associated with reactive astrogliosis which may be missed by standard {DTI} parameters alone. Monitoring changes in {MK} allows the investigation of molecular and morphological changes in vivo due to reactive astrogliosis and may complement information available from standard {DTI} parameters. To date the use of diffusion tensor imaging has been limited to study changes in white matter integrity following traumatic insults. Given the sensitivity of {DKI} to detect microstructural changes even in the gray matter in vivo, allows the extension of the technique to understand patho-morphological changes in the whole brain following a traumatic insult.},

These classifiers have been further applied in complex cognitive tasks to improve performance, in one example as an input to adaptive automation. In order to produce generalizable results and facilitate the development of practical systems, these techniques should be stable across repeated sessions. This paper describes the application of three popular pattern classification techniques to {EEG} data obtained from asymptotically trained subjects performing a complex multitask across five days in one month. All three classifiers performed well above chance levels. The performance of all three was significantly negatively impacted by classifying across days; however two modifications are presented that substantially reduce misclassifications.

To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function ({HRF}) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function ({TRF}) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high {\textless}strong{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/strong{\textgreater}, the model returns {HRFs} that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and {TRFs} that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the {TRF} remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of {fMRI} recordings made in the context of a task.},

	abstract = {We propose an original method for detecting and localizing anomalous motion patterns in videos from a camera view -based motion representation perspective. Anomalous motion should be taken in a broad sense, i.e., unexpected, abnormal, singular, irregular, or unusual motion. Identifying distinctive dynamic information at any time point and at any image location in a sequence of images is a key requirement in many situations and applications. The proposed method relies on so-called labeled affine flows ({LAF}) involving both affine velocity vectors and affine motion classes. At every pixel a motion class is inferred from the affine motion model selected in a set of candidate models estimated over a collection of windows. Then, the image is subdivided in blocks where motion class histograms weighted by the affine motion vector magnitudes are computed. They are compared blockwise to histograms of normal behaviours with a dedicated distance. More specifically, we introduce the local outlier factor ({LOF}) to detect anomalous blocks. {LOF} is a local flexible measure of the relative density of data points in a feature space, here the space of {LAF} histograms. By thresholding the {LOF} value, we can detect an anomalous motion pattern in any block at any time instant of the video sequence. The threshold value is automatically set in each block by means of statistical arguments. We report comparative experiments on several real video datasets, demonstrating that our method is highly competitive for the intricate task of detecting different types of anomalous motion in videos. Specifically, we obtain very competitive results on all the tested datasets: 99.2 {\textbackslash}\% {AUC} for {UMN}, 82.8 {\textbackslash}\% {AUC} for {UCSD}, and 95.73 {\textbackslash}\% accuracy for {PETS} 2009, at the frame level.},

Current full implementations of {OpenVX} are given in the programming language C, which does not support advanced programming paradigms such as object-oriented, imperative and functional programming, nor does it have runtime or type-checking. Here we present a python-based full Implementation of {OpenVX}, which eliminates much of the discrepancies between the object-oriented paradigm used by many modern applications and the native C implementations. Our open-source implementation can be used for rapid development of {OpenVX} applications in embedded platforms. Demonstration includes static and real-time image acquisition and processing using a Raspberry Pi and a {GoPro} camera. Code is given as supplementary information. Code project and linked deployable virtual machine are located on {GitHub}: https://github.com/{NBEL}-lab/{PythonOpenVX}.},

In this project, a novel omnidirectional camera rig, inspired from natural vision sensors, is proposed. It is exclusively designed to operate for highly specified tasks in the field of mobile robotics. Navigation problems on uneven terrains and detection of the moving objects while the robot is itself in motion are the core problems that omnidirectional systems tackle. The proposed omnidirectional system is a compact and a rigid vision system with dioptric cameras that provide a 360 degrees field-of-view in horizontal and vertical, with no blind spot in their site combined with a high-resolution stereo camera to monitor anterior field-of-view for a more accurate perception with depth information of the scene. Structure-from-motion algorithm is adapted and implemented to prove the design validity of the proposed camera rig and a toolbox is developed to calibrate similar systems.},

The architecture developed here allows realtime goal-directed exploration and learning of the possible motor patterns (e.g. for locomotion) of embodied systems of arbitrary morphology. Examples of its successful application to a simple biomechanical model and a simulated 3D swimming robot are given. The tractability of the biomechanical systems allows detailed analysis of the overall dynamics of the search process. This analysis points out strong parallels with evolutionary search.},

	abstract = {We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to {MEG} planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked {EEG} responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/{EEG} signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

Redundant information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to two or more predictor variables     X i    . It can be thought of as quantifying overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S between the     X i    . We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information Decomposition ({PID}) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems, including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is provided, including all considered examples.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works {PRIME} [1] and {ISAAC} [2] demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory ({ReRAM}) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, {ISAAC} attempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in {ISAAC} is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present {PipeLayer}, a {ReRAM}-based {PIM} accelerator for {CNNs} that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight update in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replication. With these design choices, {PipeLayer} enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work. The experiment results show that, {PipeLayer} achieves the speedup of 42.45x compared with {GPU} platform on average. The average energy saving of {PipeLayer} compared with {GPU} implementation is 7.17x.},

However, formal information theoretic definitions until very recently were only available for information transfer and storage, not for modification. This has changed with the extension of Shannon information theory via the decomposition of the mutual information between inputs to and the output of a process into unique, shared and synergistic contributions from the inputs, called a partial information decomposition ({PID}). The synergistic contribution in particular has been identified as the basis for a definition of information modification. We here review the requirements for a functional definition of information modification in neuroscience, and apply a recently proposed measure of information modification to investigate the developmental trajectory of information modification in a culture of neurons vitro, using partial information decomposition. We found that modification rose with maturation, but ultimately collapsed when redundant information among neurons took over. This indicates that this particular developing neural system initially developed intricate processing capabilities, but ultimately displayed information processing that was highly similar across neurons, possibly due to a lack of external inputs. We close by pointing out the enormous promise {PID} and the analysis of information modification hold for the understanding of neural systems.},

	abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z {\textless} 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" ({TFCE}). We present the {TFCE} approach and discuss in detail {ROC}-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that {TFCE} gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and {SNR} values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that {TFCE} does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

This two-way communication allows us to monitor the state of the brain and its composite networks and cells as well as to influence them to treat disease or repair/restore sensory or motor function. To provide the most stable and effective interface, the tools of the trade must bridge the soft, ion-rich, and evolving nature of neural tissue with the largely rigid, static realm of microelectronics and medical instruments that allow for readout, analysis, and/or control. In this Review, we describe how the understanding of neural signaling and material-tissue interactions has fueled the expansion of the available tool set. New probe architectures and materials, nanoparticles, dyes, and designer genetically encoded proteins push the limits of recording and stimulation lifetime, localization, and specificity, blurring the boundary between living tissue and engineered tools. Understanding these approaches, their modality, and the role of cross-disciplinary development will support new neurotherapies and prostheses and provide neuroscientists and neurologists with unprecedented access to the brain.

The 500-μm-wide and 55-μm-thick transducer membrane exhibits a resonant frequency of 780 {kHz}, which is within the effective frequency range for stimulating cells. We also demonstrate successful in vitro experiments by stimulating cells using the fabricated {pMUT} array and verifying the stimulation using fluorescence calcium imaging.

In such applications, the amount of data transmitted by the sensor node should be minimized. This is because the energy available in these battery powered sensors is limited. In this paper, we study the wireless transmission of electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals. We propose the use of a compressed sensing ({CS}) framework to efficiently compress these signals at the sensor node. Our framework exploits both the temporal correlation within {EEG} signals and the spatial correlations amongst the {EEG} channels. We show that our framework is up to eight times more energy efficient than the typical wavelet compression method in terms of compression and encoding computations and wireless transmission. We also show that for a fixed compression ratio, our method achieves a better reconstruction quality than the {CS}-based state-of-the art method. We finally demonstrate that our method is robust to measurement noise and to packet loss and that it is applicable to a wide range of {EEG} signal types.},

	abstract = {The measurement of activity in vivo and in vitro has shifted from electrical to optical methods. While the indicators for imaging activity have improved significantly over the last decade, tools for analysing optical data have not kept pace. Most available analysis tools are limited in their flexibility and applicability to datasets obtained at different spatial scales. Here, we present {SamuROI} (Structured analysis of multiple user-defined {ROIs}), an open source Python-based analysis environment for imaging data. {SamuROI} simplifies exploratory analysis and visualization of image series of fluorescence changes in complex structures over time and is readily applicable at different spatial scales. In this paper, we show the utility of {SamuROI} in Ca(2+)-imaging based applications at three spatial scales: the micro-scale (i.e., sub-cellular compartments including cell bodies, dendrites and spines); the meso-scale, (i.e., whole cell and population imaging with single-cell resolution); and the macro-scale (i.e., imaging of changes in bulk fluorescence in large brain areas, without cellular resolution). The software described here provides a graphical user interface for intuitive data exploration and region of interest ({ROI}) management that can be used interactively within Jupyter Notebook: a publicly available interactive Python platform that allows simple integration of our software with existing tools for automated {ROI} generation and post-processing, as well as custom analysis pipelines. {SamuROI} software, source code and installation instructions are publicly available on {GitHub} and documentation is available online. {SamuROI} reduces the energy barrier for manual exploration and semi-automated analysis of spatially complex Ca(2+) imaging datasets, particularly when these have been acquired at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic understanding of how the brain gives rise to complex behavioral and cognitive functions is one of science’s grand challenges. The technical challenges that we face as we attempt to gain a systems-level understanding of the brain are manifold. The brain’s structural complexity requires us to push the limit of imaging resolution and depth, while being able to cover large areas, resulting in enormous data acquisition and processing needs. Furthermore, it is necessary to detect functional activities and ‘map’ them onto the structural features. The functional activity occurs at multiple levels, using electrical and chemical signals. Certain electrical signals are only decipherable with sub-millisecond timescale resolution, while other modes of signals occur in minutes to hours. For these reasons, there is a wide consensus that new tools are necessary to undertake this daunting task. Optical techniques, due to their versatile and scalable nature, have great potentials to answer these challenges. Optical microscopy can now image beyond the diffraction limit, record multiple types of brain activity, and trace structural features across large areas of tissue. Genetically encoded molecular tools opened doors to controlling and detecting neural activity using light in specific cell types within the intact brain. Novel sample preparation methods that reduce light scattering have been developed, allowing whole brain imaging in rodent models. Adaptive optical methods have the potential to resolve images from deep brain regions. In this roadmap article, we showcase a few major advances in this area, survey the current challenges, and identify potential future needs that may be used as a guideline for the next steps to be taken.},

The diameter of the array is approximately 26 µm along the full extent of the implant. Main results . Carbon fiber arrays were tested in {HVC} (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

Existing approaches for delivering light to cells expressing {ChR}2 rely upon microscopes, lasers, arc lamps and shutters, all of which are relatively expensive and are not readily scalable for use on more than one brain region or animal at a time. In this paper, we describe an inexpensive method for delivering blue light locally and with millisecond precision to cells expressing {ChR}2. We accomplished this by coupling the light from a high-intensity blue light-emitting diode ({LED}; {XLamp} {XR}-E from {CREE}) into an optical fiber. When positioned in proximity to {ChR}2-expressing {HEK}293 cells, this fiber-coupled {LED} provided localized illumination of up to 32 {mW}/mm2 and generated {ChR}2 photocurrents as efficiently as wide-field mercury arc lamp illumination. This fiber-coupled {LED} was also used to photostimulate action potentials in {ChR}2-expressing dorsal root ganglia ({DRG}) sensory neurons. {LED} light power and pulse frequency were controlled with an inexpensive, custom-built amplifier circuit. This scalable fiber-coupled {LED} system can be used to deliver light independent of the microscope objective and could, in principle, deliver light in parallel to multiple brain regions or to multiple genetically engineered animals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We propose a new framework to capture the key principles of how local activity influences global computation, i.e., describing the propagation of information and thus the broadness of communication driven by local activity. More specifically, we consider the diversity in space (nodes or brain regions) over time using the concept of intrinsic ignition, which are naturally occurring intrinsic perturbations reflecting the capability of a given brain area to propagate neuronal activity to other regions in a given brain state. Characterizing the profile of intrinsic ignition for a given brain state provides insight into the precise nature of hierarchical information processing. Combining this data-driven method with a causal whole-brain computational model can provide novel insights into the imbalance of brain states found in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

We have long known of the existence of a great deal of uninterrupted brain activity that maintains the body in a stable state — from an evolutionary standpoint one of the brain's most ancient tasks. But intrinsic, ongoing activity is not limited to subcortical, life-maintaining structures; cortex, too, is remarkably active even in the absence of a sensory stimulus or a specific behavioral task. This is evident both in its enormous energy consumption at rest and in the large, spontaneous but coherent fluctuations of neural activity that spread across different areas. Not surprisingly, a growing number of electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies are appearing that report on various aspects of the brain's spontaneous activity or “default mode” of operation. One recent study reports results from simultaneously combined electrophysiological and {fMRI} measurements in the monkey visual cortex (Shmuel, A., Leopold, D.A., 2008. Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in {fMRI} signals in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional connectivity at rest. Hum. Brain Mapp. 29, 751–761).

They even go on to speculate that the fluctuations display wave-like spatiotemporal patterns across cortex. In the present report, however, we re-analyze the data presented in that study and demonstrate that the measurements were not actually taken during rest. Visual cortex was subject to almost imperceptible but physiologically clearly detectable flicker induced by the visual stimulator. An examination of the power spectral density of the neural responses and the neurovascular impulse response function shows that such imperceptible flicker strongly suppresses the slow oscillations and changes the degree of covariance between neural and vascular signals. In addition, a careful analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns demonstrates that no slow waves of activity exist in visual cortex; instead, the presented wave data reflect differences in signal-to-noise ratio at various cortical sites due to local differences in vascularization. In this report, assuming that the term “spontaneous activity” refers to intrinsic physiological processes at the absence of sensory inputs or motor outputs, we discuss the need for careful selection of experimental protocols and of examining the degree to which the activation of sensory areas might influence the cortical or subcortical processes in other brain regions.},

	abstract = {Much recent work in systems neuroscience has focused on how dynamic interactions between different cortical regions underlie complex brain functions such as motor coordination, language, and emotional regulation. Various studies using neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques have suggested that in many neuropsychiatric disorders, these dynamic brain networks are dysregulated. Here we review the utility of combined noninvasive brain stimulation and neuroimaging approaches towards greater understanding of dynamic brain networks in health and disease. Brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, use electromagnetic principles to noninvasively alter brain activity, and induce focal but also network effects beyond the stimulation site. When combined with brain imaging techniques such as functional {MRI}, {PET} and {EEG}, these brain stimulation techniques enable a causal assessment of the interaction between different network components, and their respective functional roles. The same techniques can also be applied to explore hypotheses regarding the changes in functional connectivity that occur during task performance and in various disease states such as stroke, depression and schizophrenia. Finally, in diseases characterized by pathologic alterations in either the excitability within a single region or in the activity of distributed networks, such techniques provide a potential mechanism to alter cortical network function and architectures in a beneficial manner.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interface ({BCI}) systems are a promising means for restoring communication to patients suffering from “locked-in” syndrome. Research to improve system performance primarily focuses on means to overcome the low signal to noise ratio of electroencephalogric ({EEG}) recordings. However, the literature and methods are difficult to compare due to the array of evaluation metrics and assumptions underlying them, including that: 1) all characters are equally probable, 2) character selection is memoryless, and 3) errors occur completely at random. The standardization of evaluation metrics that more accurately reflect the amount of information contained in {BCI} language output is critical to make progress. We present a mutual information-based metric that incorporates prior information and a model of systematic errors. The parameters of a system used in one study were re-optimized, showing that the metric used in optimization significantly affects the parameter values chosen and the resulting system performance. The results of 11 {BCI} communication studies were then evaluated using different metrics, including those previously used in {BCI} literature and the newly advocated metric. Six studies' results varied based on the metric used for evaluation and the proposed metric produced results that differed from those originally published in two of the studies. Standardizing metrics to accurately reflect the rate of information transmission is critical to properly evaluate and compare {BCI} communication systems and advance the field in an unbiased manner.},

Mathematical models are used to predict the distribution of out-of-focus light caused by the inherent optical limitations of the instrument, which can then be compensated for using computer algorithms. This unit will review the theory of image formation and characteristics of the point spread function ({PSF}) based on the instrument modality and objective lens parameters. A variety of commonly used deblurring and deconvolution methods are described, and their applications to sample datasets are illustrated to show the performance of each algorithm. Steps for setting up the image acquisition to acquire data suitable for deconvolution are described, and the challenge of maximizing signal levels while minimizing light exposure addressed. Deconvolution examples from widefield epi-fluorescence and laser scanning confocal are shown, and suitability for other modalities discussed. Curr. Protoc.

However, achieving quantitative Fourier space measurements requires a thorough understanding of the impact of aberrations introduced by optical microscopes that have been optimized for conventional real-space imaging. Here we present a detailed framework for analyzing the performance of microscope objectives for several common Fourier imaging configurations. To this end, we model objectives from Nikon, Olympus, and Zeiss using parameters that were inferred from patent literature and confirmed, where possible, by physical disassembly. We then examine the aberrations most relevant to Fourier microscopy, including the alignment tolerances of apodization factors for different objective classes, the effect of magnification on the modulation transfer function, and vignetting-induced reductions of the effective numerical aperture for wide-field measurements. Based on this analysis, we identify an optimal objective class and imaging configuration for Fourier microscopy. In addition, the Zemax files for the objectives and setups used in this analysis have been made publicly available as a resource for future studies.},

Update (9/14/2015, Version 2, filenames annotated with "\_v2" suffix): For all objectives files and the objective catalog, the immersion oil layer semi-diameter has been changed to float so as to prevent unrealistic vignetting that may otherwise occur. Additionally, for all multiconfiguration files, the "before image plane" configuration has been modified. Specifically, the position of the Bertrand Lens has been modified so that it correctly images the {BFP} image onto the real image plane. In all cases, this required a shift in the position of the Bertrand Lens of {\textasciitilde}1cm further from the tube lens.

The necessity to analyze large volumetric data sets accurately, efficiently, and in true 3D has been a major bottleneck in deriving reliable relationships between altered neuronal function and changes in spine morphology. We introduce a novel system for automated detection, shape analysis and classification of dendritic spines from laser scanning microscopy ({LSM}) images that directly addresses these limitations. The system is more accurate, and at least an order of magnitude faster, than existing technologies. By operating fully in 3D the algorithm resolves spines that are undetectable with standard two-dimensional (2D) tools. Adaptive local thresholding, voxel clustering and Rayburst Sampling generate a profile of diameter estimates used to classify spines into morphologic types, while minimizing optical smear and quantization artifacts. The technique opens new horizons on the objective evaluation of spine changes with synaptic plasticity, normal development and aging, and with neurodegenerative disorders that impair cognitive function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The time-of-flight ({ToF}) technique is an emerging technique for rapidly acquiring distance information and is becoming increasingly popular for intra-operative surface acquisition. Using the {ToF} technique as an intra-operative imaging modality requires seamless integration into the clinical workflow. We thus aim to integrate {ToF} support in an existing framework for medical image processing.
{METHODS}: {MITK}-{ToF} was implemented as an extension of the open-source C++ Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit ({MITK}) and provides the basic functionality needed for rapid prototyping and development of image-guided therapy ({IGT}) applications that utilize range data for intra-operative surface acquisition. This framework was designed with a module-based architecture separating the hardware-dependent image acquisition task from the processing of the range data.
{RESULTS}: The first version of {MITK}-{ToF} has been released as an open-source toolkit and supports several {ToF} cameras and basic processing algorithms. The toolkit, a sample application, and a tutorial are available from http://mitk.org.
{CONCLUSIONS}: With the increased popularity of time-of-flight cameras for intra-operative surface acquisition, integration of range data supports into medical image processing toolkits such as {MITK} is a necessary step. Handling acquisition of range data from different cameras and processing of the data requires the establishment and use of software design principles that emphasize flexibility, extendibility, robustness, performance, and portability. The open-source toolkit {MITK}-{ToF} satisfies these requirements for the image-guided therapy community and was already used in several research projects.},

{NEW} {METHOD}: We have developed lcg, a software suite based on a command-line interface ({CLI}) that allows performing both standard and advanced electrophysiological experiments. Stimulation protocols for classical voltage and current clamp experiments are defined by a concise and flexible meta description that allows representing complex waveforms as a piece-wise parametric decomposition of elementary sub-waveforms, abstracting the stimulation hardware. To perform complex experiments lcg provides a set of elementary building blocks that can be interconnected to yield a large variety of experimental paradigms.
{RESULTS}: We present various cellular electrophysiological experiments in which lcg has been employed, ranging from the automated application of current clamp protocols for characterizing basic electrophysiological properties of neurons, to dynamic clamp, response clamp, and hybrid experiments. We finally show how the scripting capabilities behind a {CLI} are suited for integrating experimental trials into complex workflows, where actual experiment, online data analysis and computational modeling seamlessly integrate.
{COMPARISON} {WITH} {EXISTING} {METHODS}: We compare lcg with two open source toolboxes, {RTXI} and {RELACS}.

Automated tracking of animal movement is less labor-intensive and bias-prone than direct observation, and allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple animals, high spatial and temporal resolution, and data collection over extended periods of time. Here, we present a new video-tracking system built on Python-based software that is free, open source, and cross-platform, and that can analyze video input from widely available video capture devices such as smartphone cameras and webcams. We validated this software through four tests on a variety of animal species, including larval and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), Siberian dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), and wild birds. These tests highlight the capacity of our software for long-term data acquisition, parallel analysis of multiple animals, and application to animal species of different sizes and movement patterns. We applied the software to an analysis of the effects of ethanol on thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behavior on adult zebrafish, and found that acute ethanol treatment decreased thigmotaxis behaviors without affecting overall amounts of motion. The open source nature of our software enables flexibility, customization, and scalability in behavioral analyses. Moreover, our system presents a free alternative to commercial video-tracking systems and is thus broadly applicable to a wide variety of educational settings and research programs.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Non-adherence to prescribed medications is a serious health problem in the United States, costing an estimated \$100 billion per year. While poor adherence should be addressable with point of care health information technology, integrating new solutions with existing electronic health records ({EHR}) systems require customization within each organization, which is difficult because of the monolithic software design of most {EHR} products.
{OBJECTIVE}: The objective of this study was to create a published algorithm for predicting medication adherence problems easily accessible at the point of care through a Web application that runs on the Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusuable Technologies ({SMART}) platform. The {SMART} platform is an emerging framework that enables {EHR} systems to behave as "{iPhone} like platforms" by exhibiting an application programming interface for easy addition and deletion of third party apps. The app is presented as a point of care solution to monitoring medication adherence as well as a sufficiently general, modular application that may serve as an example and template for other {SMART} apps.
{METHODS}: The widely used, open source Django framework was used together with the {SMART} platform to create the interoperable components of this app. Django uses Python as its core programming language. This allows statistical and mathematical modules to be created from a large array of Python numerical libraries and assembled together with the core app to create flexible and sophisticated {EHR} functionality. Algorithms that predict individual adherence are derived from a retrospective study of dispensed medication claims from a large private insurance plan. Patients' prescription fill information is accessed through the {SMART} framework and the embedded algorithms compute adherence information, including predicted adherence one year after the first prescription fill. Open source graphing software is used to display patient medication information and the results of statistical prediction of future adherence on a clinician-facing Web interface.
{RESULTS}: The user interface allows the physician to quickly review all medications in a patient record for potential non-adherence problems. A gap-check and current medication possession ratio ({MPR}) threshold test are applied to all medications in the record to test for current non-adherence. Predictions of 1-year non-adherence are made for certain drug classes for which external data was available. Information is presented graphically to indicate present non-adherence, or predicted non-adherence at one year, based on early prescription fulfillment patterns. The {MPR} Monitor app is installed in the {SMART} reference container as the "{MPR} Monitor", where it is publically available for use and testing. {MPR} is an acronym for Medication Possession Ratio, a commonly used measure of adherence to a prescribed medication regime. This app may be used as an example for creating additional functionality by replacing statistical and display algorithms with new code in a cycle of rapid prototyping and implementation or as a framework for a new {SMART} app.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {MPR} Monitor app is a useful pilot project for monitoring medication adherence. It also provides an example that integrates several open source software components, including the Python-based Django Web framework and python-based graphics, to build a {SMART} app that allows complex decision support methods to be encapsulated to enhance {EHR} functionality.},

@article{hill_recording_2012-1,
	title = {Recording human electrocorticographic ({ECoG}) signals for neuroscientific research and real-time functional cortical mapping},
	issn = {1940-087X},
	doi = {10.3791/3993},
	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography ({EEG}), magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography ({ECoG}) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than {EEG}, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., {\textless}1 cm/{\textless}1 millisecond, respectively). {ECoG} involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that {ECoG} amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function. {ECoG} can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing ({BCI}) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and control. Nevertheless, human {ECoG} data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human {ECoG} data. We describe our methods for collecting recording {ECoG}, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the {BCI}2000 software platform and the {SIGFRIED} method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation. {PREREQUISITES} {AND} {PLANNING}: Patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on previous {EEG} monitoring, on a structural {MRI} of the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to acquire human {ECoG} data for neuroscientific research. The decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the {ECoG} electrodes are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.{USBamp} amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are safety-rated and {FDA}-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are found, and they come with an {SDK} that allows them to be integrated with custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than that of the typical {EEG} experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our {BCI}2000 software. {BCI}2000 is a freely available general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in C++, {MATLAB} or Python. {BCI}2000 consists of four modules that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant {ECoG} features and translates them into output signals; an Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our experimentation using the {SIGFRIED} ({SIGnal} modeling For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical stimulation ({ECS}). Although {ECS} mapping remains the gold standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of {ECS} mapping is time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and refined by {ECS}. The results from our passive {SIGFRIED} mapping technique have been shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using {ECS} mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology for gathering human {ECoG} data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using the {BCI}2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the {BCI}2000-based {SIGFRIED} system.},

	abstract = {Integration and display of results from multiple neuroimaging modalities [e.g. magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), magnetoencephalography, {EEG}] relies on display of a diverse range of data within a common, defined coordinate frame. {DataViewer}3D ({DV}3D) is a multi-modal imaging data visualization tool offering a cross-platform, open-source solution to simultaneous data overlay visualization requirements of imaging studies. While {DV}3D is primarily a visualization tool, the package allows an analysis approach where results from one imaging modality can guide comparative analysis of another modality in a single coordinate space. {DV}3D is built on Python, a dynamic object-oriented programming language with support for integration of modular toolkits, and development of cross-platform software for neuroimaging. {DV}3D harnesses the power of the Visualization Toolkit ({VTK}) for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D rendering, calling {VTK}'s low level C++ functions from Python. Users interact with data via an intuitive interface that uses Python to bind {wxWidgets}, which in turn calls the user's operating system dialogs and graphical user interface tools. {DV}3D currently supports {NIfTI}-1, {ANALYZE} and {DICOM} formats for {MRI} data display (including statistical data overlay). Formats for other data types are supported. The modularity of {DV}3D and ease of use of Python allows rapid integration of additional format support and user development. {DV}3D has been tested on Mac {OSX}, {RedHat} Linux and Microsoft Windows {XP}. {DV}3D is offered for free download with an extensive set of tutorial resources and example data.},

	abstract = {We constructed a simple and compact imaging system designed specifically for the recording of fast neuronal activity in a 3D volume. The system uses an Yb:{KYW} femtosecond laser we designed for use with acousto-optic deflection. An integrated two-axis acousto-optic deflector, driven by digitally synthesized signals, can target locations in three dimensions. Data acquisition and the control of scanning are performed by a {LeCroy} digital oscilloscope. The total cost of construction was one order of magnitude lower than that of a typical Ti:sapphire system. The entire imaging apparatus, including the laser, fits comfortably onto a small rig for electrophysiology. Despite the low cost and simplicity, the convergence of several new technologies allowed us to achieve the following capabilities: i) full-frame acquisition at video rates suitable for patch clamping; ii) random access in under ten microseconds with dwelling ability in the nominal focal plane; iii) three-dimensional random access with the ability to perform fast volume sweeps at kilohertz rates; and iv) fluorescence lifetime imaging. We demonstrate the ability to record action potentials with high temporal resolution using intracellularly loaded potentiometric dye di-2-{ANEPEQ}. Our design proffers easy integration with electrophysiology and promises a more widespread adoption of functional two-photon imaging as a tool for the study of neuronal activity. The software and firmware we developed is available for download at http://neurospy.org/ under an open source license.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11548-011-0636-7},
	shorttitle = {{TREK}},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: A system architecture has been developed for integration of intraoperative 3D imaging [viz., mobile C-arm cone-beam {CT} ({CBCT})] with surgical navigation (e.g., trackers, endoscopy, and preoperative image and planning data). The goal of this paper is to describe the architecture and its handling of a broad variety of data sources in modular tool development for streamlined use of {CBCT} guidance in application-specific surgical scenarios.
{METHODS}: The architecture builds on two proven open-source software packages, namely the cisst package (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, {MD}) and 3D Slicer (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, {MA}), and combines data sources common to image-guided procedures with intraoperative 3D imaging. Integration at the software component level is achieved through language bindings to a scripting language (Python) and an object-oriented approach to abstract and simplify the use of devices with varying characteristics. The platform aims to minimize offline data processing and to expose quantitative tools that analyze and communicate factors of geometric precision online. Modular tools are defined to accomplish specific surgical tasks, demonstrated in three clinical scenarios (temporal bone, skull base, and spine surgery) that involve a progressively increased level of complexity in toolset requirements.
{RESULTS}: The resulting architecture (referred to as "{TREK}") hosts a collection of modules developed according to application-specific surgical tasks, emphasizing streamlined integration with intraoperative {CBCT}. These include multi-modality image display; 3D-3D rigid and deformable registration to bring preoperative image and planning data to the most up-to-date {CBCT}; 3D-2D registration of planning and image data to real-time fluoroscopy; infrared, electromagnetic, and video-based trackers used individually or in hybrid arrangements; augmented overlay of image and planning data in endoscopic or in-room video; and real-time "virtual fluoroscopy" computed from {GPU}-accelerated digitally reconstructed radiographs ({DRRs}). Application in three preclinical scenarios (temporal bone, skull base, and spine surgery) demonstrates the utility of the modular, task-specific approach in progressively complex tasks.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The design and development of a system architecture for image-guided surgery has been reported, demonstrating enhanced utilization of intraoperative {CBCT} in surgical applications with vastly different requirements. The system integrates C-arm {CBCT} with a broad variety of data sources in a modular fashion that streamlines the interface to application-specific tools, accommodates distinct workflow scenarios, and accelerates testing and translation of novel toolsets to clinical use. The modular architecture was shown to adapt to and satisfy the requirements of distinct surgical scenarios from a common code-base, leveraging software components arising from over a decade of effort within the imaging and computer-assisted interventions community.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiology requires an extensive workflow of information analysis routines, which often includes incompatible proprietary software, introducing limitations based on financial costs, transfer of data between platforms, and the ability to share. An ecosystem of free open-source software exists to fill these gaps, including thousands of analysis and plotting packages written in Python and R, which can be implemented in a sharable and reproducible format, such as the Jupyter electronic notebook. This tool chain can largely replace current routines by importing data, producing analyses, and generating publication-quality graphics. An electronic notebook like Jupyter allows these analyses, along with documentation of procedures, to display locally or remotely in an internet browser, which can be saved as an {HTML}, {PDF}, or other file format for sharing with team members and the scientific community. The present report illustrates these methods using data from electrophysiological recordings of the musk shrew vagus-a model system to investigate gut-brain communication, for example, in cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. We show methods for spike sorting (including statistical validation), spike train analysis, and analysis of compound action potentials in notebooks. Raw data and code are available from notebooks in data supplements or from an executable online version, which replicates all analyses without installing software-an implementation of reproducible research. This demonstrates the promise of combining disparate analyses into one platform, along with the ease of sharing this work. In an age of diverse, high-throughput computational workflows, this methodology can increase efficiency, transparency, and the collaborative potential of neurophysiological research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recently, the availability of high-resolution microscopy together with the advancements in the development of biomarkers as reporters of biomolecular interactions increased the importance of imaging methods in molecular cell biology. These techniques enable the investigation of cellular characteristics like volume, size and geometry as well as volume and geometry of intracellular compartments, and the amount of existing proteins in a spatially resolved manner. Such detailed investigations opened up many new areas of research in the study of spatial, complex and dynamic cellular systems. One of the crucial challenges for the study of such systems is the design of a well stuctured and optimized workflow to provide a systematic and efficient hypothesis verification. Computer Science can efficiently address this task by providing software that facilitates handling, analysis, and evaluation of biological data to the benefit of experimenters and modelers.
{RESULTS}: The Spatio-Temporal Simulation Environment ({STSE}) is a set of open-source tools provided to conduct spatio-temporal simulations in discrete structures based on microscopy images. The framework contains modules to digitize, represent, analyze, and mathematically model spatial distributions of biochemical species. Graphical user interface ({GUI}) tools provided with the software enable meshing of the simulation space based on the Voronoi concept. In addition, it supports to automatically acquire spatial information to the mesh from the images based on pixel luminosity (e.g. corresponding to molecular levels from microscopy images). {STSE} is freely available either as a stand-alone version or included in the linux live distribution Systems Biology Operational Software ({SB}.{OS}) and can be downloaded from http://www.stse-software.org/. The Python source code as well as a comprehensive user manual and video tutorials are also offered to the research community. We discuss main concepts of the {STSE} design and workflow. We demonstrate it's usefulness using the example of a signaling cascade leading to formation of a morphological gradient of Fus3 within the cytoplasm of the mating yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {STSE} is an efficient and powerful novel platform, designed for computational handling and evaluation of microscopic images. It allows for an uninterrupted workflow including digitization, representation, analysis, and mathematical modeling. By providing the means to relate the simulation to the image data it allows for systematic, image driven model validation or rejection. {STSE} can be scripted and extended using the Python language. {STSE} should be considered rather as an {API} together with workflow guidelines and a collection of {GUI} tools than a stand alone application. The priority of the project is to provide an easy and intuitive way of extending and customizing software using the Python language.},

The summary is the clustering result and feature subset that maximize the gap statistic. The notion of meaningful summarization is captured by using the gap statistic to estimate the randomness deficiency from algorithmic statistics. When applied to movies of cultured neural progenitor cells, it correctly distinguished neurons from progenitors without requiring the use of a fixative stain. When analyzing intra-cellular molecular transport in cultured neurons undergoing axon specification, it automatically confirmed the role of kinesins in axon specification. Finally, it was able to differentiate wild type from genetically modified thymocyte cells.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and {ForceAtlas}2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. {ForceAtlas}2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

In this regard, we present a meta-analysis of 93 research papers which addresses three main dimensions of those papers: i) the empirical methods employed, ii) the datasets they used and iii) the limitations reported. Results of our meta-analysis show some concerns regarding the dataset collection process and size, the low level of replicability, poor sampling techniques, lack of longitudinal studies and scarce variety of methodologies.},

We proposed a {HITS} based influence analysis on graphs that represent the star relationship between Github users and repositories. A weighted version of {HITS} is applied to the overall star graph, and generates a different set of top influential repositories other than the results from standard version of {HITS} algorithm.

	abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature—an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in {CiteSpace} {II}, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981–2004) and terrorism (1990–2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Visual overviews that show temporal patterns of paper publication and citation links among papers can help researchers and analysts to see the rate of growth of topics, identify key papers, and understand influences across subdisciplines. This article applies a novel network-visualization tool based on meaningful layouts of nodes to present research fronts and show citation links that indicate influences across research fronts. To demonstrate the value of two-dimensional layouts with multiple regions and user control of link visibility, we conducted a design-oriented, preliminary case study with 6 domain experts over a 4-month period. The main benefits were being able (a) to easily identify key papers and see the increasing number of papers within a research front, and (b) to quickly see the strength and direction of influence across related research fronts. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Neural networks that compute over graph structures are a natural fit for problems in a variety of domains, including natural language (parse trees) and cheminformatics (molecular graphs). However, since the computation graph has a different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models. Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel implementations for a variety of models from the literature.},

By considering the image database as a huge repository, {MindFinder} is able to help users present and refine their initial thoughts in their mind, and finally turn thoughts to a beautiful image(s). Multiple actions are enabled for users to flexibly design their queries in a bilateral interactive manner by leveraging the whole image database, including tagging, refining query by dragging and dropping objects from search results, as well as editing objects. After each action, the search results will be updated in real time to provide users up-to-date materials to further formulate the query. By the deliberate but easy design of the query, {MindFinder} not only tries to enable users to present on the query panel whatever they are imagining, but also returns to users the most similar images to the picture in users' mind. By scaling up the image database to 10 million, {MindFinder} has the potential to reveal whatever in users' mind, that is where the name {MindFinder} comes from.},

The system allows the user to build and edit graphs and attach attributes to graph nodes specifying details of the computation (gains, masks, et cetera). Once the graph is adequately connected, the system traverses the graph, analyzes the data dependencies, and constructs an execution schedule. It then repeatedly executes the schedule, mapping graph nodes to specific hardware resources as needed.

A motivating example is a problem of tracking multiple interacting nanoparticles imaged on video frames, where particles can aggregate into one particle or a particle can be split into multiple particles. Many existing multitarget tracking methods are capable of tracking non-interacting targets or tracking interacting targets of restricted degrees of interactions. The proposed formulation solves a multitarget tracking problem for general degrees of inter-object interactions. The formulation is in the form of a binary integer programming problem. We propose a polynomial time solution approach that can obtain a good relaxation solution of the binary integer programming, so the approach can be applied for multitarget tracking problems of a moderate size (for hundreds of targets over tens of time frames). The resulting solution is always integral and obtains a better duality gap than the simple linear relaxation solution of the corresponding problem. The proposed method was validated through applications to simulated multitarget tracking problems and a real multitarget tracking problem.},

	abstract = {We propose a framework for general multiple target tracking, where the input is a set of candidate regions in each frame, as obtained from a state of the art background learning, and the goal is to recover trajectories of targets over time from noisy observations. Due to occlusions by targets and static objects, noisy segmentation and false alarms, one foreground region may not correspond to one target faithfully. Therefore the one-to-one assumption used in most data association algorithm is not always satisﬁed. Our method overcomes the one-to-one assumption by formulating the visual tracking problem in terms of ﬁnding the best spatial and temporal association of observations, which maximizes the consistency of both motion and appearance of trajectories. To avoid enumerating all possible solutions, we take a Data Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({DD}-{MCMC}) approach to sample the solution space efﬁciently. The sampling is driven by an informed proposal scheme controlled by a joint probability model combining motion and appearance. To make sure the Markov chain to converge to a desired distribution, we propose an automatic approach to determine the parameters in the target distribution. Comparative experiments with quantitative evaluations are provided.},

Theoretically, compression-based similarity depends on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity but implementations require suitable (normal) compression algorithms. We argue that the approach is of interest for challenging image applications but we identify one obstacle: standard high-performance image compression methods are not normal, and normal methods such as Lempel-Ziv type algorithms might not perform well for images. To demonstrate the potential of compression-based similarity measures we propose an algorithm that is based on finite-context models and works directly on the intensity domain of the image. The proposed algorithm is compared with several other methods.},

However, there is no previous study on how the measure should be used: which compressor and image format are the most suitable. This paper presents a practical study of the Normalized Compression Distance ({NCD}) applied to color images. The questions we try to answer are: Is {NCD} a suitable metric for image comparison? How robust is it to rotation, translation, and scaling? Which are the most adequate image formats and compression algorithms? The results of our study show that {NCD} can be used to address some of the selected image comparison problems, but care must be taken on the compressor and image format selected.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10219},
	abstract = {Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler ({KL}) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of \$n\$ elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex \$S\_\{n-1\}\$, which is the set of all probability distributions over \$n\$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}\$ to distribution \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\}\$, where \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}\$, \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\} {\textbackslash}in S\_\{n-1\}\$. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost \$C(\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}, \{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\})\$ was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{p\}\}=\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\}\$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold \$S\_\{n-1\} {\textbackslash}times S\_\{n-1\}\$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in \$S\_\{n-1\}\$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the {KL}-divergence.},

We propose a practical and robust approach of video stabilization that produces full-frame stabilized videos with good visual quality. While most previous methods end up with producing smaller size stabilized videos, our completion method can produce full-frame videos by naturally filling in missing image parts by locally aligning image data of neighboring frames. To achieve this, motion inpainting is proposed to enforce spatial and temporal consistency of the completion in both static and dynamic image areas. In addition, image quality in the stabilized video is enhanced with a new practical deblurring algorithm. Instead of estimating point spread functions, our method transfers and interpolates sharper image pixels of neighboring frames to increase the sharpness of the frame. The proposed video completion and deblurring methods enabled us to develop a complete video stabilizer which can naturally keep the original image quality in the stabilized videos. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by extensive experiments over a wide variety of videos},

Our method allows for video stabilization beyond the conventional filtering of camera paths that only suppresses high frequency jitter. We incorporate additional constraints on the path of the camera directly in our algorithm, allowing for stabilized and retargeted videos.

The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here, we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information.},

We describe a reproducible and simple procedure for chronic through-bone wide-field imaging in awake head-fixed mice providing stable optical access for chronic imaging over large areas of the cortex for months. The preparation is produced by applying clear-drying dental cement to the intact mouse skull, followed by a glass coverslip to create a partially transparent imaging surface. Surgery time takes about 30min. A single set-screw provides a stable means of attachment (in relation to the measured lateral and axial resolution) for mesoscale assessment without obscuring the cortical field of view. We demonstrate the utility of this method by showing seed-pixel functional connectivity maps generated from spontaneous cortical activity of {GCAMP}6 signals in both awake and anesthetized mice in longitudinal studies of up to 2 months in duration. We propose that the intact skull preparation described here may be used for most longitudinal studies that do not require micron scale resolution and where cortical neural or vascular signals are recorded with intrinsic sensors or in transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded sensors of activity.},

A major technological goal in neuroscience is to enable the interrogation of individual cells across the live brain. By creating a curved glass replacement to the dorsal cranium and surgical methods for its installation, we developed a chronic mouse preparation providing optical access to an estimated 800,000–1,100,000 individual neurons across the dorsal surface of neocortex. Post-surgical histological studies revealed comparable glial activation as in control mice. In behaving mice expressing a Ca2+ indicator in cortical pyramidal neurons, we performed Ca2+ imaging across neocortex using an epi-fluorescence macroscope and estimated that 25,000–50,000 individual neurons were accessible per mouse across multiple focal planes. Two-photon microscopy revealed dendritic morphologies throughout neocortex, allowed time-lapse imaging of individual cells, and yielded estimates of {\textgreater}1 million accessible neurons per mouse by serial tiling. This approach supports a variety of optical techniques and enables studies of cells across {\textgreater}30 neocortical areas in behaving mice.},

We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.},

During the stereotactical surgery procedure, the cannula has to be placed correctly in the x-y directions and also with respect to the injection point in the z-direction (deepness). However, the flat fixation base of available cannula holders doesn’t allow an easy, secure fixation onto the curve-shaped skull. We have developed a modified method for a better fixation of the cannula holder by using an easy-to-produce, skull-shaped silicone spacer as fixation adapter. We describe the application and its fast and reliable production in the lab. Superglue or cement is currently being used as the method of choice. However, the curve-shaped skull surface does not fit well with the flat and rigid cannula adapter which leads to fixation problems over time causing wide infusion channels and often also to leakage problems from intracerebrally applied agents towards the surface meninges. As another consequence of the inappropriate fixation, the cannula may loosen from the skull before the end of the experiment or it causes damage to the brain tissue, harming the animals with leading to a failure of the whole experiment. The easy-to-produce spacer facilitates the crucial step of long-term, stereotactic brain infusion experiments with intracerebral catheters in a highly secure and reproducible way.},

Neuronal representations change as associations are learned between sensory stimuli and behavioral actions. However, it is poorly understood whether representations for learned associations stabilize in cortical association areas or continue to change following learning. We tracked the activity of posterior parietal cortex neurons for a month as mice stably performed a virtual-navigation task. The relationship between cells’ activity and task features was mostly stable on single days but underwent major reorganization over weeks. The neurons informative about task features (trial type and maze locations) changed across days. Despite changes in individual cells, the population activity had statistically similar properties each day and stable information for over a week. As mice learned additional associations, new activity patterns emerged in the neurons used for existing representations without greatly affecting the rate of change of these representations. We propose that dynamic neuronal activity patterns could balance plasticity for learning and stability for memory.},

We propose that it is the interaction between persistence and transience that allows for intelligent decision-making in dynamic, noisy environments. Specifically, we argue that transience (1) enhances flexibility, by reducing the influence of outdated information on memory-guided decision-making, and (2) prevents overfitting to specific past events, thereby promoting generalization. According to this view, the goal of memory is not the transmission of information through time, per se. Rather, the goal of memory is to optimize decision-making. As such, transience is as important as persistence in mnemonic systems.},

Furthermore, {FAST} is highly scalable to non-human primate brains and human postmortem brain tissues, and can visualize neuronal projections in a whole adult marmoset brain.

The successful planning and execution of adaptive behaviors in mammals may require long-range coordination of neural networks throughout cerebral cortex. The neuronal implementation of signals that could orchestrate cortex-wide activity remains unclear. Here, we develop and apply methods for cortex-wide Ca2+ imaging in mice performing decision-making behavior and identify a global cortical representation of task engagement encoded in the activity dynamics of both single cells and superficial neuropil distributed across the majority of dorsal cortex. The activity of multiple molecularly defined cell types was found to reflect this representation with type-specific dynamics. Focal optogenetic inhibition tiled across cortex revealed a crucial role for frontal cortex in triggering this cortex-wide phenomenon; local inhibition of this region blocked both the cortex-wide response to task-initiating cues and the voluntary behavior. These findings reveal cell-type-specific processes in cortex for globally representing goal-directed behavior and identify a major cortical node that gates the global broadcast of task-related information.},

Neuronal stimulus selectivity is shaped by feedforward and recurrent excitatory-inhibitory interactions. In the auditory cortex ({AC}), parvalbumin- ({PV}) and somatostatin-positive ({SOM}) inhibitory interneurons differentially modulate frequency-dependent responses of excitatory neurons. Responsiveness of neurons in the {AC} to sound is also dependent on stimulus history. We found that the inhibitory effects of {SOMs} and {PVs} diverged as a function of adaptation to temporal repetition of tones. Prior to adaptation, suppressing either {SOM} or {PV} inhibition drove both increases and decreases in excitatory spiking activity. After adaptation, suppressing {SOM} activity caused predominantly disinhibitory effects, whereas suppressing {PV} activity still evoked bi-directional changes. {SOM}, but not {PV}-driven inhibition, dynamically modulated frequency tuning with adaptation. Unlike {PV}-driven inhibition, {SOM}-driven inhibition elicited gain-like increases in frequency tuning reflective of adaptation. Our findings suggest that distinct cortical interneurons differentially shape tuning to sensory stimuli across the neuronal receptive field, altering frequency selectivity of excitatory neurons during adaptation.},

Ca2+ imaging techniques permit time-lapse recordings of neuronal activity from large populations over weeks. However, without identifying the same neurons across imaging sessions (cell registration), longitudinal analysis of the neural code is restricted to population-level statistics. Accurate cell registration becomes challenging with increased numbers of cells, sessions, and inter-session intervals. Current cell registration practices, whether manual or automatic, do not quantitatively evaluate registration accuracy, possibly leading to data misinterpretation. We developed a probabilistic method that automatically registers cells across multiple sessions and estimates the registration confidence for each registered cell. Using large-scale Ca2+ imaging data recorded over weeks from the hippocampus and cortex of freely behaving mice, we show that our method performs more accurate registration than previously used routines, yielding estimated error rates {\textless}5\%, and that the registration is scalable for many sessions. Thus, our method allows reliable longitudinal analysis of the same neurons over long time periods.},

	abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that there is an optimal size for software components. This means that components that are too small or too big will have a higher defect content (i.e., there is a U-shaped curve relating defect content to size). The U-shaped curve has become known as the "Goldilocks Conjecture." Recently, a cognitive theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon and it has been expanded to characterize object-oriented software. This conjecture has wide implications for software engineering practice. It suggests 1) that designers should deliberately strive to design classes that are of the optimal size, 2) that program decomposition is harmful, and 3) that there exists a maximum (threshold) class size that should not be exceeded to ensure fewer faults in the software. The purpose of the current paper is to evaluate this conjecture for object-oriented systems. We first demonstrate that the claims of an optimal component/class size (1) above) and of smaller components/classes having a greater defect content (2) above) are due to a mathematical artifact in the analyses performed previously. We then empirically test the threshold effect claims of this conjecture (3) above). To our knowledge, the empirical test of size threshold effects for object-oriented systems has not been performed thus far. We performed an initial study with an industrial C++ system and repeated it twice on another C++ system and on a commercial Java application. Our results provide unambiguous evidence that there is no threshold effect of class size. We obtained the same result for three systems using four different size measures. These findings suggest that there is a simple continuous relationship between class size and faults, and that, optimal class size, smaller classes are better and threshold effects conjectures have no sound theoretical nor empirical basis},

This model-driven, generative approach, which was inspired by {UML}, integrates concepts targeted at the {IoT}. Over the past six years, it has been continuously evolved and applied to cases in different domains, including a commercial e-health solution.},

	abstract = {The analysis of texture is an important subroutine in application areas as diverse as biology, medicine, robotics, and forensic science. While the last three decades have seen extensive research in algorithms to measure texture similarity, almost all existing methods require the careful setting of many parameters. There are many problems associated with a lot of parameters, the most obvious of which is that with many parameters to fit, it is very difficult to avoid overfitting. In this work, we propose to extend recent advances in Kolmogorov complexity-based similarity measures to texture matching problems. These Kolmogorov-based methods have been shown to be very useful in intrinsically discrete domains such as {DNA}, protein sequences, {MIDI} music, and natural languages; however, they are not well defined for real-valued data. To address this, we introduce a very simple idea, the Campana-Keogh ({CK}) video compression-based method for texture measures. These measures utilize video compressors to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity. Using the parameter-free {CK} method, we novely utilize lossy compression to create an efficient and robust parameter-lite texture similarity measure: the {CK}-1 distance measure. We demonstrate the utility of our measure with extensive empirical evaluations on real-world case studies drawn from nematology, arachnology, entomology, medicine, forensics, texture analysis benchmarks, and many other domains.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Neural stem cells are motile and proliferative cells that undergo mitosis, dividing to produce daughter cells and ultimately generating differentiated neurons and glia. Understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. Stem cell studies in vitro from 2-D image data are well established. Visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task. It becomes more difficult as the dimensionality of the image data increases to include time and additional fluorescence channels. There is a pressing need for 5-D image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate.
{RESULTS}: We present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-D (x,y,z,t,channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images. The image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology. Our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-D window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-D window. Using the {GPU} to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach. An inference-based approach utilizing user-provided edits to automatically correct related mistakes executes interactively on the system {CPU} while the {GPU} handles 3-D visualization tasks.
{CONCLUSIONS}: By exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments. We combine unsupervised image analysis algorithms with an interactive visualization of the results. Our validation interface allows for each data set to be corrected to 100\% accuracy, ensuring that downstream data analysis is accurate and verifiable. Our tool is the first to combine all of these aspects, leveraging the synergies obtained by utilizing validation information from stereo visualization to improve the low level image processing tasks.},

Using this method, we asked whether rat retinal progenitor cells ({RPCs}) display characteristic phenotypes before undergoing mitosis that could foretell their fate. We predicted whether {RPCs} will undergo a self-renewing or terminal division with 99\% accuracy, or whether they will produce two photoreceptors or another combination of offspring with 87\% accuracy. Our implementation can segment, track and generate predictions for 40 cells simultaneously on a standard computer at 5 min per frame.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0312044},
	abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or {NCD}, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The {NCD} is universal in that it is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal compressor, and show that the {NCD} based on a normal compressor is a similarity metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

Custom computational tools are built to best exploit application-specific knowledge in order to visualize and analyze large and complex data sets.

	abstract = {Background
A unique archive of Big Data on Parkinson’s Disease is collected, managed and disseminated by the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative ({PPMI}). The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data–large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources–all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for {PD} classification and prediction. To explore {PD} risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex {PPMI} imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data.

Methods and Findings
Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation. Using heterogeneous {PPMI} data, we developed a comprehensive protocol for end-to-end data characterization, manipulation, processing, cleaning, analysis and validation. Specifically, we (i) introduce methods for rebalancing imbalanced cohorts, (ii) utilize a wide spectrum of classification methods to generate consistent and powerful phenotypic predictions, and (iii) generate reproducible machine-learning based classification that enables the reporting of model parameters and diagnostic forecasting based on new data. We evaluated several complementary model-based predictive approaches, which failed to generate accurate and reliable diagnostic predictions. However, the results of several machine-learning based classification methods indicated significant power to predict Parkinson’s disease in the {PPMI} subjects (consistent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity exceeding 96\%, confirmed using statistical n-fold cross-validation). Clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS}) scores), demographic (e.g., age), genetics (e.g., rs34637584, chr12), and derived neuroimaging biomarker (e.g., cerebellum shape index) data all contributed to the predictive analytics and diagnostic forecasting.

Conclusions
Model-free Big Data machine learning-based classification methods (e.g., adaptive boosting, support vector machines) can outperform model-based techniques in terms of predictive precision and reliability (e.g., forecasting patient diagnosis). We observed that statistical rebalancing of cohort sizes yields better discrimination of group differences, specifically for predictive analytics based on heterogeneous and incomplete {PPMI} data. {UPDRS} scores play a critical role in predicting diagnosis, which is expected based on the clinical definition of Parkinson’s disease. Even without longitudinal {UPDRS} data, however, the accuracy of model-free machine learning based classification is over 80\%. The methods, software and protocols developed here are openly shared and can be employed to study other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as for other predictive Big Data analytics applications.},

Here we describe our ‘Firefly’ microscope, which achieves these goals in a Ø6 mm {FOV}. The Firefly optical system is optimized for simultaneous photostimulation and fluorescence imaging in cultured cells. All but one of the optical elements are commercially available, yet the microscope achieves 10-fold higher light collection efficiency at its design magnification than the comparable commercially available microscope using the same objective. The Firefly microscope enables all-optical electrophysiology (‘Optopatch’) in cultured neurons with a throughput and information content unmatched by other neuronal phenotyping systems.

To address this issue, we have developed a novel, open-source software package to control high-speed, multispectral optical imaging systems. The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface ({GUI}) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive {IEEE} 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences. The complete software suite is available for free download. Here we describe the software’s framework and provide details to guide users with development of this and similar software.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567},
	shorttitle = {Deep Neuroevolution},
	abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks ({DNNs}) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies ({ES}) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning ({RL}) problems. However, {ES} can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at {DNN} scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a {DNN} with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm ({GA}) and it performs well on hard deep {RL} problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep {GA} successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which {GAs} can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of techniques that have been developed in the neuroevolution community to improve performance on {RL} problems. To demonstrate the latter, we show that combining {DNNs} with novelty search, which was designed to encourage exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. {DQN}, A3C, {ES}, and the {GA}) fail. Additionally, the Deep {GA} parallelizes better than {ES}, A3C, and {DQN}, and enables a state-of-the-art compact encoding technique that can represent million-parameter {DNNs} in thousands of bytes.},

	abstract = {Light field cameras have many advantages over traditional cameras, as they allow the user to change various camera settings after capture. However, capturing light fields requires a huge bandwidth to record the data: a modern light field camera can only take three images per second. This prevents current consumer light field cameras from capturing light field videos. Temporal interpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible as too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames. Instead, we develop a hybrid imaging system, adding another standard video camera to capture the temporal information. Given a 3 fps light field sequence and a standard 30 fps 2D video, our system can then generate a full light field video at 30 fps. We adopt a learning-based approach, which can be decomposed into two steps: spatio-temporal flow estimation and appearance estimation. The flow estimation propagates the angular information from the light field sequence to the 2D video, so we can warp input images to the target view. The appearance estimation then combines these warped images to output the final pixels. The whole process is trained end-to-end using convolutional neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms current video interpolation methods, enabling consumer light field videography, and making applications such as refocusing and parallax view generation achievable on videos for the first time.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01692},
	abstract = {Standard video frame interpolation methods first estimate optical flow between input frames and then synthesize an intermediate frame guided by motion. Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.},

	abstract = {We present Calipso, an interactive method for editing images and videos in a physically-coherent manner. Our main idea is to realize physics-based manipulations by running a full physics simulation on proxy geometries given by non-rigidly aligned {CAD} models. Running these simulations allows us to apply new, unseen forces to move or deform selected objects, change physical parameters such as mass or elasticity, or even add entire new objects that interact with the rest of the underlying scene. In Calipso, the user makes edits directly in 3D; these edits are processed by the simulation and then transfered to the target 2D content using shape-to-image correspondences in a photo-realistic rendering process. To align the {CAD} models, we introduce an efficient {CAD}-to-image alignment procedure that jointly minimizes for rigid and non-rigid alignment while preserving the high-level structure of the input shape. Moreover, the user can choose to exploit image flow to estimate scene motion, producing coherent physical behavior with ambient dynamics. We demonstrate Calipso's physics-based editing on a wide range of examples producing myriad physical behavior while preserving geometric and visual consistency.},

The inherent closedloop responsiveness and decision making of {IoT} applications make them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed Stream Processing Systems ({DSPS}) hosted on Cloud data-centers are becoming the vital engine for real-time data processing and analytics in any {IoT} software architecture. But the efficacy and performance of contemporary {DSPS} have not been rigorously studied for {IoT} applications and data streams. Here, we develop {RIoTBench}, a Realtime {IoT} Benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate {DSPS} for streaming {IoT} applications. The benchmark includes 27 common {IoT} tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as reusable micro-benchmarks. Further, we propose four {IoT} application benchmarks composed from these tasks, and that leverage various dataflow semantics of {DSPS}. The applications are based on common {IoT} patterns for data pre-processing, statistical summarization and predictive analytics. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real {IoT} observations on smart cities and fitness, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10000 messages/sec and diverse frequency distributions. We validate the {RIoTBench} suite for the popular Apache Storm {DSPS} on the Microsoft Azure public Cloud, and present empirical observations. This suite can be used by {DSPS} researchers for performance analysis and resource scheduling, and by {IoT} practitioners to evaluate {DSPS} platforms.},

Moreover, when the camera motion is jittery, most of the existing motion segmentation approaches fail. In this work, we propose an optimization framework for the segmentation of moving object in jittery videos. A novel Optical Trajectory Descriptor Matrix ({OTDM}) built on point trajectories has been proposed for this purpose. An optimization function has been formulated for stabilizing the trajectories, followed by spectral clustering of the proposed latent trajectories. Latent trajectories are obtained by performing Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis ({pLSA}) on the {OTDM} (factorization of {OTDM} using {KL} divergence). This integrated framework yields accurate clustering of the trajectories from jittery videos. Foreground pixel labelling is obtained by utilizing the clustered trajectory coordinates for modelling the foreground and background, using a {GraphCut} based energy formulation. Experiments were performed on 16 real-world jittery videos. Also, the results have been generated for a standard segmentation dataset, {SegTrackv}2, with synthetic jitter incorporated. Jitter extracted from a real video is inserted into stable {SegTrackv}2 videos for analysis of performance. The proposed method, when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, was found to be superior.},

	abstract = {In order to understand how populations of neurons encode information about external correlates, it is important to develop minimal models of the probability of neural population responses which capture all the salient changes of neural responses with stimuli. In this context, it is particularly useful to determine whether interactions among neurons responding to stimuli can be described by a pairwise interaction model, or whether a higher order interaction model is needed. To address this question, we compared real neural population activity obtained from the rat somatosensory cortex to maximum-entropy models which take into account only interaction of up any given order. By performing these comparisons, we found that interactions of order two were sufficient to explain a large amount of observed stimulus-response distributions, but not all of them. Triple-wise interactions were necessary to fully explain the data. We then used Shannon information to compute the impact of high order correlations on the amount of somatosensory information transmitted by the neural population. We found that correlations of order two gave a good approximation of information carried by the neural population, within 4\% of the true value. Third order correlations gave an even better approximation, within 2\% of the true value. Taken together, these results suggest that higher order interactions exist and shape the dynamics of cortical networks, but play a quantitatively minor role in determining the information capacity of neural populations.},

	abstract = {In order for patients with disabilities to control assistive devices with their own neural activity, multineuronal spike trains must be efficiently decoded because only limited computational resources can be used to generate prosthetic control signals in portable real-time applications. In this study, we compare the abilities of two vectorizing procedures (multineuronal and time-segmental) to extract information from spike trains during the same total neuron-seconds. In the multineuronal vectorizing procedure, we defined a response vector whose components represented the spike counts of one to five neurons. In the time-segmental vectorizing procedure, a response vector consisted of components representing a neuron’s spike counts for one to five time-segment(s) of a response period of 1 s. Spike trains were recorded from neurons in the inferior temporal cortex of monkeys presented with visual stimuli. We examined whether the amount of information of the visual stimuli carried by these neurons differed between the two vectorizing procedures. The amount of information calculated with the multineuronal vectorizing procedure, but not the time-segmental vectorizing procedure, significantly increased with the dimensions of the response vector. We conclude that the multineuronal vectorizing procedure is superior to the time-segmental vectorizing procedure in efficiently extracting information from neuronal signals.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the genuine and random synchronization indexes in multivariate neural series, denoted as {GSI} (genuine synchronization index) and {RSI} (random synchronization index), by means of a correlation matrix analysis and surrogate technique. The performance of the method is evaluated by using a multi-channel neural mass model ({MNMM}), including the effects of different coupling coefficients, signal to noise ratios ({SNRs}) and time-window widths on the estimation of the {GSI} and {RSI}. Results show that the {GSI} and the {RSI} are superior in description of the synchronization in multivariate neural series compared to the S-estimator. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to analyze a 21-channel scalp electroencephalographic recording of a 35 year-old male who suffers from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The {GSI} and the {RSI} at different frequency bands during the epileptic seizure are estimated. The present results could be helpful for us to understand the synchronization mechanism of epileptic seizures.},

In spite of the large diffusion of micro-electrode-array-based systems, researchers usually find it difficult to manage the huge quantity of data routinely recorded during the experimental sessions. In fact, many of the available open-source toolboxes still lack two fundamental requirements for treating multi-channel recordings: (i) a rich repertoire of algorithms for extracting information both at a single channel and at the whole network level; (ii) the capability of autonomously repeating the same set of computational operations to ‘multiple’ recording streams (also from different experiments) and without a manual intervention. The software package we are proposing, named {SPYCODE}, was mainly developed to respond to the above constraints and generally to offer the scientific community a ‘smart’ tool for multi-channel data processing.},

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1746-1596},
	doi = {10.1186/1746-1596-8-92},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Digital pathology images are increasingly used both for diagnosis and research, because slide scanners are nowadays broadly available and because the quantitative study of these images yields new insights in systems biology. However, such virtual slides build up a technical challenge since the images occupy often several gigabytes and cannot be fully opened in a computer's memory. Moreover, there is no standard format. Therefore, most common open source tools such as {ImageJ} fail at treating them, and the others require expensive hardware while still being prohibitively slow.
{RESULTS}: We have developed several cross-platform open source software tools to overcome these limitations. The {NDPITools} provide a way to transform microscopy images initially in the loosely supported {NDPI} format into one or several standard {TIFF} files, and to create mosaics (division of huge images into small ones, with or without overlap) in various {TIFF} and {JPEG} formats. They can be driven through {ImageJ} plugins. The {LargeTIFFTools} achieve similar functionality for huge {TIFF} images which do not fit into {RAM}. We test the performance of these tools on several digital slides and compare them, when applicable, to standard software. A statistical study of the cells in a tissue sample from an oligodendroglioma was performed on an average laptop computer to demonstrate the efficiency of the tools.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our open source software enables dealing with huge images with standard software on average computers. They are cross-platform, independent of proprietary libraries and very modular, allowing them to be used in other open source projects. They have excellent performance in terms of execution speed and {RAM} requirements. They open promising perspectives both to the clinician who wants to study a single slide and to the research team or data centre who do image analysis of many slides on a computer cluster.

	doi = {10.1186/1751-0473-4-5},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Video cameras sense passively from a distance, offer a rich information stream, and provide intuitively meaningful raw data. Camera-based imaging has thus proven critical for many advances in neuroscience and biology, with applications ranging from cellular imaging of fluorescent dyes to tracking of whole-animal behavior at ecologically relevant spatial scales.
{RESULTS}: Here we present 'Motmot': an open-source software suite for acquiring, displaying, saving, and analyzing digital video in real-time. At the highest level, Motmot is written in the Python computer language. The large amounts of data produced by digital cameras are handled by low-level, optimized functions, usually written in C. This high-level/low-level partitioning and use of select external libraries allow Motmot, with only modest complexity, to perform well as a core technology for many high-performance imaging tasks. In its current form, Motmot allows for: (1) image acquisition from a variety of camera interfaces (package motmot.cam\_iface), (2) the display of these images with minimal latency and computer resources using {wxPython} and {OpenGL} (package motmot.wxglvideo), (3) saving images with no compression in a single-pass, low-{CPU}-use format (package motmot.{FlyMovieFormat}), (4) a pluggable framework for custom analysis of images in realtime and (5) firmware for an inexpensive {USB} device to synchronize image acquisition across multiple cameras, with analog input, or with other hardware devices (package motmot.fview\_ext\_trig). These capabilities are brought together in a graphical user interface, called '{FView}', allowing an end user to easily view and save digital video without writing any code. One plugin for {FView}, '{FlyTrax}', which tracks the movement of fruit flies in real-time, is included with Motmot, and is described to illustrate the capabilities of {FView}.
{CONCLUSION}: Motmot enables realtime image processing and display using the Python computer language. In addition to the provided complete applications, the architecture allows the user to write relatively simple plugins, which can accomplish a variety of computer vision tasks and be integrated within larger software systems. The software is available at http://code.astraw.com/projects/motmot.},

Positron emission tomography imaging reveals neuroinflammation associated with an immune response against {MHC}-mismatched grafted cells. Immunohistological analyses reveal that {MHC}-matching reduces the immune response by suppressing the accumulation of microglia (Iba-1+) and lymphocytes ({CD}45+) into the grafts. Consequently, {MHC}-matching increases the survival of grafted dopamine neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase: {TH}+). The effect of an immunosuppressant, Tacrolimus, is also confirmed in the same experimental setting. Our results demonstrate the rationale for {MHC}-matching in neural cell grafting to the brain and its feasibility in a clinical setting. Major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) matching improves graft survival rates after organ transplantation.

	abstract = {The banking of human leukocyte antigen ({HLA})-homozygous-induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}) is considered a future clinical strategy for {HLA}-matched cell transplantation to reduce immunological graft rejection. Here we show the efficacy of major histocompatibility complex ({MHC})-matched allogeneic neural cell grafting in the brain, which is considered a less immune-responsive tissue, using {iPSCs} derived from an {MHC} homozygous cynomolgus macaque. Positron emission tomography imaging reveals neuroinflammation associated with an immune response against {MHC}-mismatched grafted cells. Immunohistological analyses reveal that {MHC}-matching reduces the immune response by suppressing the accumulation of microglia (Iba-1+) and lymphocytes ({CD}45+) into the grafts. Consequently, {MHC}-matching increases the survival of grafted dopamine neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase: {TH}+). The effect of an immunosuppressant, Tacrolimus, is also confirmed in the same experimental setting. Our results demonstrate the rationale for {MHC}-matching in neural cell grafting to the brain and its feasibility in a clinical setting. Major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) matching improves graft survival rates after organ transplantation. Here the authors show that in macaques, {MHC}-matched {iPSC}-derived neurons provide better engraftment in the brain, with a lower immune response and higher survival of the transplanted neurons.},

	abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPS} cells) are a promising source for a cell-based therapy to treat Parkinson’s disease ({PD}), in which midbrain dopaminergic neurons progressively degenerate. However, long-term analysis of human {iPS} cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate {PD} models has never been performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human {iPS} cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of {PD} (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin {MPTP}. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that the mature dopaminergic neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum; this effect was consistent regardless of whether the cells were derived from patients with {PD} or from healthy individuals. Cells sorted by the floor plate marker {CORIN} did not form any tumours in the brains for at least two years. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were used to monitor the survival, expansion and function of the grafted cells as well as the immune response in the host brain. Thus, this preclinical study using a primate model indicates that human {iPS} cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors are clinically applicable for the treatment of patients with {PD}.},

The implementation of design controls and embedded risk management must begin prior to commercial development to reap the full benefit of the approach; partial approaches dilute or negate the effectiveness and efficiency of this nearly century-old systems engineering paradigm. Properly employing engineering design controls is a strategic business decision. The central value of this proposition is the reduction of economic, technical, and operational risks for both producers and consumers; regulatory compliance is a secondary benefit.

In this case, the introduction of a rapid prototyping stereolithographic medical model for manufacturing a large cranioplasty implant is considered to be an improvement over other traditional techniques. Because of the accuracy of the physical model, the surgeon has a good understanding of the cranial defect and precise fitting implants can be fabricated in order to re-establish skull contours for the patient.

Neurons transmit information to distant brain regions via long-range axonal projections. In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe {MAPseq} (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random {RNA} sequences (“barcodes”). Axons are filled with barcode {mRNA}, each putative projection area is dissected, and the barcode {mRNA} is extracted and sequenced. Applying {MAPseq} to the locus coeruleus ({LC}), we find that individual {LC} neurons have preferred cortical targets. By recasting neuroanatomy, which is traditionally viewed as a problem of microscopy, as a problem of sequencing, {MAPseq} harnesses advances in sequencing technology to permit high-throughput interrogation of brain circuits.},

Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, {ImageJ} enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike---a feat that arguably no other image analysis package, commercial or open source, has yet achieved. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a unique community that spans the biological and physical sciences, making {ImageJ} an invaluable resource across countless disciplines. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, {ImageJ} at a critical development crossroads. We present {ImageJ}2, a total redesign of {ImageJ} offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic {ImageJ} interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. {ImageJ}2 provides a framework adaptable to future needs, enabling continued success and innovation.},

	abstract = {The functions of synapsins were examined by characterizing the phenotype of mice in which all three synapsin genes were knocked out. Although these triple knock-out mice were viable and had normal brain anatomy, they exhibited a number of behavioral defects. Synaptic transmission was altered in cultured neurons from the hippocampus of knock-out mice. At excitatory synapses, loss of synapsins did not affect basal transmission evoked by single stimuli but caused a threefold increase in the rate of synaptic depression during trains of stimuli. This suggests that synapsins regulate the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles. This possibility was examined further by measuring synaptic vesicle density in living neurons transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged synaptobrevin 2, a marker of synaptic vesicles. The relative amount of fluorescent synaptobrevin was substantially lower at synapses of knock-out neurons than of wild-type neurons. Electron microscopy also revealed a parallel reduction in the number of vesicles in the reserve pool of vesicles {\textgreater}150 nm away from the active zone at excitatory synapses. Thus, synapsins are required for maintaining vesicles in the reserve pool at excitatory synapses. In contrast, basal transmission at inhibitory synapses was reduced by loss of synapsins, but the kinetics of synaptic depression were unaffected. In these terminals, there was a mild reduction in the total number of synaptic vesicles, but this was not restricted to the reserve pool of vesicles. Thus, synapsins maintain the reserve pool of glutamatergic vesicles but regulate the size of the readily releasable pool of {GABAergic} vesicles.},

To improve {hVoS} signals, we systematically varied the optical properties, membrane targeting motifs, and linkages of fluorescent proteins to optimize the normalized fluorescence change (ΔF/F) and signal/noise ratio. The best results were obtained with cerulean fluorescent protein tagged N-terminally with a {GAP}43 motif and C-terminally with a truncated h-ras motif. With 100 {mV} steps in {PC}12 cells, this probe produced ΔF/F = 26\% (4 μM dipicrylamine), which was threefold greater than that obtained with the original farnesylated {EGFP} construct. We also obtained a fivefold greater signal/noise ratio, which was 70\% of a theoretical optimum. We designate this {GAP}43-{CerFP}-t-h-ras construct as {hVoS} 2.0. With the aid of a theoretical analysis, we estimated that {hVoS} 2.0 places its fluorophore ∼40 Å from the bilayer midplane. {hVoS} 2.0 performed well in cultured hippocampal neurons, where single action potentials produced clear fluorescence changes in a single trial. This improved probe should help investigators image voltage in genetically targeted neurons.},

They expand the possibilities of noninvasive analysis and have many useful properties, making them potential candidates for numerous novel applications. Notably, they have been shown that they can be tracked by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and are capable of conjugation with various cell types, including stem cells. In-depth research has been undertaken to establish these benefits, so that a deeper level of understanding of stem cell migratory pathways and differentiation, tumor migration, and improved drug delivery can be achieved. Stem cells have the ability to treat and cure many debilitating diseases with limited side effects, but a main problem that arises is in the noninvasive tracking and analysis of these stem cells. Recently, researchers have acknowledged the use of {SPIONs} for this purpose and have set out to establish suitable protocols for coating and attachment, so as to bring {MRI} tracking of {SPION}-labeled stem cells into common practice. This review paper explains the manner in which {SPIONs} are produced, conjugated, and tracked using {MRI}, as well as a discussion on their limitations. A concise summary of recently researched magnetic particle coatings is provided, and the effects of {SPIONs} on stem cells are evaluated, while animal and human studies investigating the role of {SPIONs} in stem cell tracking will be explored.Keywords: stem cells, nanoparticle, magnetic},

An Electron Multiplying {CCD} ({EMCCD}) detector is employed for both optical channels, each capable of simultaneously delivering sub-electron effective read noise under multiplication gain and frame rates of up to 26 fps full frame (several 1000 fps windowed), over a fully corrected 5 x 5 arcmin field of view. {CHIMERA} was primarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of sub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that motivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide field of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in the detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring of short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory ({iPTF}), and the upcoming Zwicky Transient Facility ({ZTF}).},

Using light, we are able to visualize the hemodynamic behavior of the brain to better understand neurovascular coupling and cerebral metabolism. In vivo optical imaging of tissue using endogenous chromophores necessitates spectroscopic detection to ensure molecular specificity as well as sufficiently high imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio, to allow dynamic physiological changes to be captured, isolated, and used as surrogate of pathophysiological processes. An optical imaging system is introduced using a 16-bands on-chip hyperspectral camera. Using this system, we show that up to three dyes can be imaged and quantified in a tissue phantom at video-rate through the optics of a surgical microscope. In vivo human patient data are presented demonstrating brain hemodynamic response can be measured intraoperatively with molecular specificity at high speed.},

	abstract = {Abstract. 
The Fourier ptychography technique in reflection mode has great potential applications in tissue imaging and optical inspection, but the current configuration either has a limitation on cut-off frequency or is not practical. By placing the imaging aperture stop outside the illumination path, the illumination numerical aperture ({NA}) can be greater than the imaging {NA} of the objective lens. Thus, the cut-off frequency achieved in the proposed optical system is greater than twice the objective’s {NA} divided by the wavelength (2NAobj/λ), which is the diffraction limit for the cut-off frequency in an incoherent epi-illumination configuration. We experimentally demonstrated that the synthesized {NA} is increased by a factor of 4.5 using the proposed optical concept. The key advantage of the proposed system is that it can achieve high-resolution imaging over a large field of view with a simple objective. It will have a great potential for applications in endoscopy, biomedical imaging, surface metrology, and industrial inspection.},

To this end we present a three-camera imaging microscope for fast tracking of multiple interacting molecules simultaneously, with high spatiotemporal resolution. The system was designed around an {ASI} {RAMM} frame using three separate tube lenses and custom multi-band dichroics to allow for enhanced detection efficiency. The frame times of the three Andor {iXon} Ultra {EMCCD} cameras are hardware synchronized to the laser excitation pulses of the three excitation lasers, such that the fluorophores are effectively immobilized during frame acquisitions and do not yield detections that are motion-blurred. Stroboscopic illumination allows robust detection from even rapidly moving molecules while minimizing bleaching, and since snapshots can be spaced out with varying time intervals, stroboscopic illumination enables a direct comparison to be made between fast and slow molecules under identical light dosage. We have developed algorithms that accurately track and co-localize multiple interacting biomolecules. The three-color microscope combined with our co-movement algorithms have made it possible for instance to simultaneously image and track how the chromosome environment affects diffusion kinetics or determine how {mRNAs} diffuse during translation. Such multiplexed single-molecule measurements at a high spatiotemporal resolution inside living cells will provide a major tool for testing models relating molecular architecture and biological dynamics.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in fluorescent confocal microscopy and voltage-sensitive and Ca2+ dyes have vastly improved our ability to image neuronal circuits. However, existing confocal systems are not fast enough or too noisy for many live-cell functional imaging studies. Here, we describe and demonstrate the function of a novel, nonscanning confocal microscopy module. The optics, which are designed to fit the standard camera port of the Olympus {BX}51WI epifluorescent microscope, achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) at high temporal resolution, making this configuration ideal for functional imaging of neuronal activities such as the voltage-sensitive dye ({VSD}) imaging. The optics employ fixed 100- × 100-pinhole arrays at the back focal plane (optical conjugation plane), above the tube lens of a usual upright microscope. The excitation light travels through these pinholes, and the fluorescence signal, emitted from subject, passes through corresponding pinholes before exciting the photodiodes of the imager: a 100- × 100-pixel metal-oxide semiconductor ({MOS})-type pixel imager with each pixel corresponding to a single 100- × 100-μm photodiode. This design eliminated the need for a scanning device; therefore, acquisition rate of the imager (maximum rate of 10 {kHz}) is the only factor limiting acquisition speed. We tested the application of the system for {VSD} and Ca2+ imaging of evoked neuronal responses on electrical stimuli in rat hippocampal slices. The results indicate that, at least for these applications, the new microscope maintains a high {SNR} at image acquisition rates of ≤0.3 ms per frame.},

High spatial resolution oxygen imaging is of particular importance because recent studies address the significance of within-tissue and within-cell heterogeneities in oxygen concentration in health and disease. Here, we report a new technique for in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs using green fluorescent protein ({GFP}). {GFP}-expressing {COS}-7 cells were briefly photoactivated with a strong blue light while lowering the oxygen concentration from 10\% to {\textless}0.001\%. Red fluorescence (excitation 520–550 nm, emission {\textgreater}580 nm) appeared after photoactivation at {\textless}2\% oxygen (the red shift of {GFP} fluorescence). The red shift disappeared after reoxygenation of the cell, indicating that the red shift is stable as long as the cell is hypoxic. The red shift of {GFP} fluorescence was also demonstrated in single cardiomyocytes isolated from the {GFP} knock-in mouse (green mouse) heart. Then, we tried in vivo molecular imaging of hypoxia in organs. The red shift could be imaged in the ischemic liver and kidney in the green mouse using macroscopic optics provided that oxygen diffusion from the atmospheric air was prevented. In crystalloid-perfused beating heart isolated from the green mouse, significant spatial heterogeneities in the red shift were demonstrated in the epicardium distal to the coronary artery ligation. We conclude that the present technique using {GFP} as an oxygen indicator may allow in vivo molecular imaging of oxygen in organs.},

We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.},

Recording the activity of large populations of neurons is an important step toward understanding the emergent function of neural circuits. Here we present a simple holographic method to simultaneously perform two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal populations across multiple areas and layers of mouse cortex in vivo. We use prior knowledge of neuronal locations, activity sparsity, and a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to extract signals from neurons imaged simultaneously and located in different focal planes or fields of view. Our laser multiplexing approach is simple and fast, and could be used as a general method to image the activity of neural circuits in three dimensions across multiple areas in the brain.},

The pipeline system for Octave and Matlab ({PSOM}) is a flexible framework for the implementation of pipelines in the form of Octave or Matlab scripts. {PSOM} does not introduce new language constructs to specify the steps and structure of the workflow. All steps of analysis are instead described by a regular Matlab data structure, documenting their associated command and options, as well as their input, output and cleaned-up files. The {PSOM} execution engine provides a number of automated services: (1) it executes jobs in parallel on a local computing facility as long as the dependencies between jobs allow for it and sufficient resources are available; (2) it generates a comprehensive record of the pipeline stages and the history of execution, which is detailed enough to fully reproduce the analysis; (3) if an analysis is started multiple times, it executes only the parts of the pipeline that need to be reprocessed. {PSOM} is distributed under an opensource {MIT} license and can be used without restriction for academic or commercial projects. The package has no external dependencies besides Matlab or Octave, is straightforward to install and supports of variety of operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac). We ran several benchmark experiments on a public database including 200 subjects, using a pipeline for the preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance images. The benchmark results showed that {PSOM} is a powerful solution for the analysis of large databases using local or distributed computing resources.},

Its temporal and spatial specificity, combined with efficacy in manipulating neuronal activity, are especially useful in studying the behavior of awake behaving animals. Conventional optogenetics, however, requires the use of lasers and optic fibers, which can place considerable restrictions on behavior. Here we combined a wirelessly controlled interface and small implantable light-emitting diode ({LED}) that allows flexible and precise placement of light source to illuminate any brain area. We tested this wireless {LED} system in vivo, in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in striatonigral neurons expressing D1-like dopamine receptors. In all mice tested, we were able to elicit movements reliably. The frequency of twitches induced by high power stimulation is proportional to the frequency of stimulation. At lower power, contraversive turning was observed. Moreover, the implanted {LED} remains effective over 50 days after surgery, demonstrating the long-term stability of the light source. Our results show that the wireless {LED} system can be used to manipulate neural activity chronically in behaving mice without impeding natural movements.},

	abstract = {Bio-inspired asynchronous event-based vision sensors are currently introducing a paradigm shift in visual information processing. These new sensors rely on a stimulus-driven principle of light acquisition similar to biological retinas. They are event-driven and fully asynchronous, thereby reducing redundancy and encoding exact times of input signal changes, leading to a very precise temporal resolution. Approaches for higher-level computer vision often rely on the realiable detection of features in visual frames, but similar definitions of features for the novel dynamic and event-based visual input representation of silicon retinas have so far been lacking. This article addresses the problem of learning and recognizing features for event-based vision sensors, which capture properties of truly spatiotemporal volumes of sparse visual event information. A novel computational architecture for learning and encoding spatiotemporal features is introduced based on a set of predictive recurrent reservoir networks, competing via winner-take-all selection. Features are learned in an unsupervised manner from real-world input recorded with event-based vision sensors. It is shown that the networks in the architecture learn distinct and task-specific dynamic visual features, and can predict their trajectories over time.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen massive, distributed datasets become the norm in neuroimaging research, and the methodologies used analyze them have, in response, become more collaborative and exploratory. Tools and infrastructure are continuously being developed and deployed to facilitate research in this context: grid computation platforms to process the data, distributed data stores to house and share them, high-speed networks to move them around and collaborative, often web-based, platforms to provide access to and sometimes manage the entire system. {BrainBrowser} is a lightweight, high-performance {JavaScript} visualization library built to provide easy-to-use, powerful, on-demand visualization of remote datasets in this new research environment. {BrainBrowser} leverages modern Web technologies, such as {WebGL}, {HTML}5 and Web Workers, to visualize 3D surface and volumetric neuroimaging data in any modern web browser without requiring any browser plugins. It is thus trivial to integrate {BrainBrowser} into any web-based platform. {BrainBrowser} is simple enough to produce a basic web-based visualization in a few lines of code, while at the same time being robust enough to create full-featured visualization applications. {BrainBrowser} can dynamically load the data required for a given visualization, so no network bandwidth needs to be waisted on data that will not be used. {BrainBrowser}'s integration into the standardized web platform also allows users to consider using 3D data visualization in novel ways, such as for data distribution, data sharing and dynamic online publications. {BrainBrowser} is already being used in two major online platforms, {CBRAIN} and {LORIS}, and has been used to make the 1TB {MACACC} dataset openly accessible.},

Large-scale projects and individual laboratories have produced hundreds of gene-specific promoter-driven Cre mouse lines invaluable for enabling genetic access to subpopulations of cells in the brain. However, the potential utility of each line may not be fully realized without systematic whole brain characterization of transgene expression patterns. We established a high-throughput in situ hybridization, imaging and data processing pipeline to describe whole brain gene expression patterns in Cre driver mice. Currently, anatomical data from over 100 Cre driver lines are publicly available via the Allen Institute’s Transgenic Characterization database, which can be used to assist researchers in choosing the appropriate Cre drivers for functional, molecular, or connectional studies of different regions and/or cell types in the brain.},

	abstract = {Experiments to monitor human brain activity during active behavior record a variety of modalities (e.g., {EEG}, eye tracking, motion capture, respiration monitoring) and capture a complex environmental context leading to large, event-rich time series datasets. The considerable variability of responses within and among subjects in more realistic behavioral scenarios requires experiments to assess many more subjects over longer periods of time. This explosion of data requires better computational infrastructure to more systematically explore and process these collections. {MOBBED} is a lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible toolkit that allows users to incorporate a computational database into their normal {MATLAB} workflow. Although capable of storing quite general types of annotated data, {MOBBED} is particularly oriented to multichannel time series such as {EEG} that have event streams overlaid with sensor data. {MOBBED} directly supports access to individual events, data frames and time-stamped feature vectors, allowing users to ask questions such as what types of events or features co-occur under various experimental conditions. A database provides several advantages not available to users who process one dataset at a time from the local file system. In addition to archiving primary data in a central place to save space and avoid inconsistencies, such a database allows users to manage, search, and retrieve events across multiple datasets without reading the entire dataset. The database also provides infrastructure for handling more complex event patterns that include environmental and contextual conditions. The database can also be used as a cache for expensive intermediate results that are reused in such activities as cross-validation of machine learning algorithms. {MOBBED} is implemented over {PostgreSQL}, a widely used open source database, and is freely available under the {GNU} general public license at http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/mobbed.},

In addition, the increasing data rates of two-photon acquisition systems imply increasing cost of computing hardware required for in-memory analysis. Here we present a Matlab toolbox, "{FocusStack}", for simple and efficient analysis of two-photon calcium imaging stacks on consumer-level hardware, with minimal memory footprint. We also present a Matlab toolbox, "{StimServer}", for generation and sequencing of visual stimuli, designed to be triggered over a network link from a two-photon acquisition system. "{FocusStack}" is compatible out of the box with several existing two-photon acquisition systems, and is simple to adapt to arbitrary binary file formats. Analysis tools such as stack alignment for movement correction, automated cell detection and peri-stimulus time histograms are already provided, and further tools can be easily incorporated. Both packages are available as publicly-accessible source-code repositories.},

Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce {HelioScan}, a software package written in {LabVIEW}, as a platform serving this dual role. {HelioScan} is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, {HelioScan} provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific {HelioScan} application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, {HelioScan} can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of {HelioScan} by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner. We recommend {HelioScan} as a convenient software framework for the in vivo imaging community.},

These back reflections are common in existing mirror-based imaging heads and tend to degrade the quality of raw measurement data. In addition, the introduction of a novel ray-transfer operator allows for the inclusion of the angular dependent data in the image reconstruction process, which results in higher image resolution. We describe in detail the system design and implementation of the hardware components as well as the transport-theory-based image reconstruction algorithm.

The preparation consisting of a head-fixed mouse on a spherical or cylindrical treadmill offers unique advantages in a variety of experimental contexts. Head fixation provides the mechanical stability necessary for optical and electrophysiological recordings and stimulation. Additionally, it can be combined with virtual environments such as T-mazes, enabling these types of recording during diverse behaviors.
New method
In this paper we present a low-cost, easy-to-build acquisition system, along with scalable computational methods to quantitatively measure behavior (locomotion and paws, whiskers, and tail motion patterns) in head-fixed mice locomoting on cylindrical or spherical treadmills.
Existing methods
Several custom supervised and unsupervised methods have been developed for measuring behavior in mice. However, to date there is no low-cost, turn-key, general-purpose, and scalable system for acquiring and quantifying behavior in mice.
Results
We benchmark our algorithms against ground truth data generated either by manual labeling or by simpler methods of feature extraction. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve good performance, both in supervised and unsupervised settings.
Conclusions
We present a low-cost suite of tools for behavioral quantification, which serve as valuable complements to recording and stimulation technologies being developed for the head-fixed mouse preparation.},

Although two-photon imaging is very powerful, high-speed imaging of the activity of individual synapses is mostly limited to a field of approximately 200 µm on a side. Wide-field one-photon epifluorescence imaging can reveal neuronal activity over a field of ≥1 mm2 at a high speed, but is not able to resolve a single synapse. Here, to achieve a high spatio-temporal resolution, we combine an 8 K ultra-high-definition camera with spinning-disk one-photon confocal microscopy. This combination allowed us to image a 1 mm2 field with a pixel resolution of 0.21 µm at 60 fps. When we imaged motor cortical layer 1 in a behaving head-restrained mouse, calcium transients were detected in presynaptic boutons of thalamocortical axons sparsely labeled with {GCaMP}6s, although their density was lower than when two-photon imaging was used. The effects of out-of-focus fluorescence changes on calcium transients in individual boutons appeared minimal. Axonal boutons with highly correlated activity were detected over the 1 mm2 field, and were probably distributed on multiple axonal arbors originating from the same thalamic neuron. This new microscopy with an 8 K ultra-high-definition camera should serve to clarify the activity and plasticity of widely distributed cortical synapses.},

	abstract = {Natural sciences generate an increasing amount of data in a wide range of formats developed by different research groups and commercial companies. At the same time there is a growing desire to share data along with publications in order to enable reproducible research. Open formats have publicly available specifications which facilitate data sharing and reproducible research. Hierarchical Data Format 5 ({HDF}5) is a popular open format widely used in neuroscience, often as a foundation for other, more specialized formats. However, drawbacks related to {HDF}5's complex specification have initiated a discussion for an improved replacement. We propose a novel alternative, the Experimental Directory Structure (Exdir), an open standard for data storage in experimental pipelines which amends drawbacks associated with {HDF}5 while retaining its advantages. {HDF}5 stores data and metadata in a hierarchy within a complex binary file which, among other things, is not human-readable, not optimal for version control systems, and lacks support for storing raw data. Exdir, one the other hand, uses file system directories to represent the hierarchy, with metadata stored in human-readable {YAML} files, datasets stored in binary {NumPy} files, and raw data stored directly in subdirectories. Furthermore, storing data in multiple files makes it easier to track for version control systems. Exdir is not a file format in itself, but a standard for organizing files in a directory structure. Exdir uses the same abstractions as {HDF}5 and is compatible with the {HDF}5 Abstract Data Model. Several research groups are already using data stored in a directory hierarchy as an alternative to {HDF}5, but no common standard exists in the field. This complicates and limits the opportunity for data sharing and development of common tools for reading, writing, and analyzing data. Exdir facilitates improved data storage, data sharing, reproducible research, and novel insight from interdisciplinary collaboration. With the publication of Exdir, we invite the scientific community to join the development to create an open standard that will serve as many needs as possible and that will serve as a foundation for open access to and exchange of data.},

	abstract = {Video streaming today accounts for up to 55{\textbackslash}\% of mobile traffic. In this paper, we explore streaming videos encoded using Scalable Video Coding scheme ({SVC}) over highly variable bandwidth conditions such as cellular networks. {SVC}'s unique encoding scheme allows the quality of a video chunk to change incrementally, making it more flexible and adaptive to challenging network conditions compared to other encoding schemes. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the quality decisions of video chunks constrained by the available bandwidth, the playback buffer, and the chunk deadlines as an optimization problem. The objective is to optimize a novel {QoE} metric that models a combination of the three objectives of minimizing the stall/skip duration of the video, maximizing the playback quality of every chunk, and minimizing the number of quality switches. Second, we develop Layered Bin Packing ({LBP}) Adaptation Algorithm, a novel algorithm that solves the proposed optimization problem. Moreover, we show that {LBP} achieves the optimal solution of the proposed optimization problem with linear complexity in the number of video chunks. Third, we propose an online algorithm (online {LBP}) where several challenges are addressed including handling bandwidth prediction errors, and short prediction duration. Extensive simulations with real bandwidth traces of public datasets reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its significant performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art {SVC} streaming algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also implemented on a {TCP}/{IP} emulation test bed with real {LTE} bandwidth traces, and the emulation confirms the simulation results and validates that the algorithm can be implemented and deployed on today's mobile devices.},

	abstract = {Entropy measures that assess signals' complexity have drawn increasing attention recently in biomedical field, as they have shown the ability of capturing unique features that are intrinsic and physiologically meaningful. In this study, we applied entropy analysis to electroencephalogram ({EEG}) data to examine its performance in epilepsy detection based on short-term {EEG}, aiming at establishing a short-term analysis protocol with optimal seizure detection performance. Two classification problems were considered, i.e., 1) classifying interictal and ictal {EEGs} (epileptic group) from normal {EEGs}; and 2) classifying ictal from interictal {EEGs}. For each problem, we explored two protocols to analyze the entropy of {EEG}: i) using a single analytical window with different window lengths, and ii) using an average of multiple windows for each window length. Two entropy methods-fuzzy entropy ({FuzzyEn}) and distribution entropy ({DistEn})-were used that have valid outputs for any given data lengths. We performed feature selection and trained classifiers based on a cross-validation process. The results show that performance of {FuzzyEn} and {DistEn} may complement each other and the best performance can be achieved by combining: 1) {FuzzyEn} of one 5-s window and the averaged {DistEn} of five 1-s windows for classifying normal from epileptic group (accuracy: 0.93, sensitivity: 0.91, specificity: 0.96); and 2) the averaged {FuzzyEn} of five 1-s windows and {DistEn} of one 5-s window for classifying ictal from interictal {EEGs} (accuracy: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.93, specificity: 0.90). Further studies are warranted to examine whether this proposed short-term analysis procedure can help track the epileptic activities in real time and provide prompt feedback for clinical practices.},

In addition, it is applicable to cases in which a nonlinear relationship exists between a state and observed data where the application of the ensemble Kalman filter ({EnKF}) is not effectual. In the {MPF}, the filtering procedure is performed based on sampling of a forecast ensemble as in the {PF}. However, unlike the {PF}, each member of a filtered ensemble is generated by merging multiple samples from the forecast ensemble such that the mean and covariance of the filtered distribution are approximately preserved. This merging of multiple samples allows the degeneration problem to be avoided. In the present study, the newly proposed {MPF} technique is introduced, and its performance is demonstrated experimentally.},

	abstract = {A central challenge in computational modeling of biological systems is the determination of the model parameters. Typically, only a fraction of the parameters (such as kinetic rate constants) are experimentally measured, while the rest are often fitted. The fitting process is usually based on experimental time course measurements of observables, which are used to assign parameter values that minimize some measure of the error between these measurements and the corresponding model prediction. The measurements, which can come from immunoblotting assays, fluorescent markers, etc., tend to be very noisy and taken at a limited number of time points. In this work we present a new approach to the problem of parameter selection of biological models. We show how one can use a dynamic recursive estimator, known as extended Kalman filter, to arrive at estimates of the model parameters. The proposed method follows. First, we use a variation of the Kalman filter that is particularly well suited to biological applications to obtain a first guess for the unknown parameters. Secondly, we employ an a posteriori identifiability test to check the reliability of the estimates. Finally, we solve an optimization problem to refine the first guess in case it should not be accurate enough. The final estimates are guaranteed to be statistically consistent with the measurements. Furthermore, we show how the same tools can be used to discriminate among alternate models of the same biological process. We demonstrate these ideas by applying our methods to two examples, namely a model of the heat shock response in E. coli, and a model of a synthetic gene regulation system. The methods presented are quite general and may be applied to a wide class of biological systems where noisy measurements are used for parameter estimation or model selection.},

In this article, we introduce optimization procedures to search for parameters in a quantitative model that can reproduce experimental data. The aim of optimization is to minimize the sum of squared errors ({SSE}) in a prediction or to maximize likelihood. A (local) maximum of likelihood or (local) minimum of the {SSE} can efficiently be identified using gradient approaches. Addition of a stochastic process enables us to identify the global maximum/minimum without becoming trapped in local maxima/minima. Sampling approaches take advantage of increasing computational power to test numerous sets of parameters in order to determine the optimum set. By combining Bayesian inference with gradient or sampling approaches, we can estimate both the optimum parameters and the form of the likelihood function related to the parameters. Finally, we introduce four examples of research that utilize parameter optimization to obtain biological insights from quantified data: transcriptional regulation, bacterial chemotaxis, morphogenesis, and cell cycle regulation. With practical knowledge of parameter optimization, cell and developmental biologists can develop realistic models that reproduce their observations and thus, obtain mechanistic insights into phenomena of interest.},

	abstract = {Distribution entropy ({DistEn}) is a recently developed measure of complexity that is used to analyse heart rate variability ({HRV}) data. Its calculation requires two input parameters-the embedding dimension m, and the number of bins M which replaces the tolerance parameter r that is used by the existing approximation entropy ({ApEn}) and sample entropy ({SampEn}) measures. The performance of {DistEn} can also be affected by the data length N. In our previous studies, we have analyzed stability and performance of {DistEn} with respect to one parameter (m or M) or combination of two parameters (N and M). However, impact of varying all the three input parameters on {DistEn} is not yet studied. Since {DistEn} is predominantly aimed at analysing short length heart rate variability ({HRV}) signal, it is important to comprehensively study the stability, consistency and performance of the measure using multiple case studies. In this study, we examined the impact of changing input parameters on {DistEn} for synthetic and physiological signals. We also compared the variations of {DistEn} and performance in distinguishing physiological (Elderly from Young) and pathological (Healthy from Arrhythmia) conditions with {ApEn} and {SampEn}. The results showed that {DistEn} values are minimally affected by the variations of input parameters compared to {ApEn} and {SampEn}. {DistEn} also showed the most consistent and the best performance in differentiating physiological and pathological conditions with various of input parameters among reported complexity measures. In conclusion, {DistEn} is found to be the best measure for analysing short length {HRV} time series.},

So far, many feature selection (also called feature reduction) methods based on Rough set have been proposed. Of which, methods based on discernibility matrix are of considerable benefits for their conciseness and effectiveness, but have much higher space complexity. In order to reduce the storage space of the existing feature selection methods based on discernibility matrix, a novel condensing tree (C-Tree) structure was introduced, which is an extended order-tree, every nonempty element of a discernibility matrix is stored in one path in the C-Tree by given order of features and lots of nonempty elements share one path or sub-path, so the C-Tree has much lower space complexity as compared to discernibility matrix. However, the size of a C-Tree greatly depends on the order of features in most cases, hence how to set the proper order of features is of importance. To generate a higher compressed C-Tree, in this paper, after introducing an efficient trick for efficiently measuring the relative importance of every feature, we present a new feature ordering strategy according to the descending order of their importance. Further, based on the new feature ordering strategy, corresponding two heuristic algorithms for feature selection are introduced. Algorithms of this paper are experimented using six standard datasets and five synthetic datasets for testing both time and space complexities. Experimental results show that the newly improved feature selection algorithm can further efficiently reduce cost of storage in most cases.},

	abstract = {Fusing the outputs of an ensemble of diverse predictive models usually boosts overall prediction accuracy. Such fusion is guided by each model's local performance, i.e., each model's prediction accuracy in the neighborhood of the probe point. Therefore, for each probe we instantiate a customized fusion mechanism. The fusion mechanism is a meta-model, i.e., a model that operates one level above the object-level models whose predictions we want to fuse. Like these models, such a meta-model is defined by structural and parametric information. In this paper, we focus on the definition of the parametric information for a given structure. For each probe point, we either retrieve or compute the parameters to instantiate the associated meta-model. The retrieval approach is based on a {CART}-derived segmentation of the probe's state space, which contains the meta-model parameters. The computation approach is based on a run-time evaluation of each model's local performance in the neighborhood of the probe. We explore various structures for the meta-model, and for each structure we compare the pre-compiled (retrieval) or run-time (computation) approaches. We demonstrate this fusion methodology in the context of multiple neural network models. However, our methodology is broadly applicable to other predictive modeling approaches. This fusion method is illustrated in the development of highly accurate models for emissions, efficiency, and load prediction in a complex power plant. The locally weighted fusion method boosts the predictive performance by 30–50\% over the baseline single model approach for the various prediction targets. Relative to this approach, typical fusion strategies that use averaging or globally weighting schemes only produce a 2–6\% performance boost over the same baseline.},

	abstract = {Sampe Entropy ({SampEn}), a measure quantifying regularity and complexity, is believed to be an effective analyzing method of diverse settings that include both deterministic chaotic and stochastic processes, particularly operative in the analysis of physiological signals that involve relatively small amount of data. However, the similarity definition of vectors is based on Heaviside function, of which the boundary is discontinuous and hard, may cause some problems in the validity and accuracy of {SampEn}. Sigmoid function is a smoothed and continuous version of Heaviside function. To overcome the problems {SampEn} encountered, a modified {SampEn} ({mSampEn}) based on nonlinear Sigmoid function was proposed. The performance of {mSampEn} was tested on the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform random numbers, the {MIX} stochastic model, the Rossler map, and the Hennon map. The results showed that {mSampEn} was superior to {SampEn} in several aspects, including giving entropy definition in case of small parameters, better relative consistency, robust to noise, and more independence on record length when characterizing time series generated from either deterministic or stochastic system with different regularities.},

	abstract = {This paper compares three related measures of complexity, {ApEn}, {SampEn}, and {FuzzyEn}. Since vectors' similarity is defined on the basis of the hard and sensitive boundary of Heaviside function in {ApEn} and {SampEn}, the two families of statistics show high sensitivity to the parameter selection and may be invalid in case of small parameter. Importing the concept of fuzzy sets, we developed a new measure {FuzzyEn}, where vectors' similarity is defined by fuzzy similarity degree based on fuzzy membership functions and vectors' shapes. The soft and continuous boundaries of fuzzy functions ensure the continuity as well as the validity of {FuzzyEn} at small parameters. The more details obtained by fuzzy functions also make {FuzzyEn} a more accurate entropy definition than {ApEn} and {SampEn}. In addition, similarity definition based on vectors' shapes, together with the exclusion of self-matches, earns {FuzzyEn} stronger relative consistency and less dependence on data length. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that {FuzzyEn} provides an improved evaluation of signal complexity and can be more conveniently and powerfully applied to short time series contaminated by noise.},

Here we use {fGp} (fractional Gaussian process) to generate exact fractional Gaussian noise ({fGn}) reference signals for one-dimensional time series. The average autocorrelation of multiple realizations of {fGn} converges to the theoretically expected autocorrelation. Two methods, commonly used to generate fractal time series, an approximate spectral synthesis ({SSM}) method and the successive random addition ({SRA}) method, do not give the correct correlation structures and should be abandoned. Time series from {fGp} were used to test how well several versions of rescaled range analysis (R/S) and dispersional analysis (Disp) estimate the Hurst coefficient (0 {\textless} H {\textless} 1.0). Disp is unbiased for H {\textless} 0.9 and series length N ⩾ 1024, but underestimates H when H {\textgreater} 0.9 R/S-detrended overestimates H for time series with H {\textless} 0.7 and underestimates H for H {\textgreater} 0.7. Estimates of H(Ĥ) from all versions of Disp usually have lower bias and variance than those from R/S. All versions of dispersional analysis, Disp, now tested on {fGp}, are better than we previously thought and are recommended for evaluating time series as long-memory processes.},

Mapping this coupling between activity pattern and gene induction would allow inference of a neuron's activity-pattern history from its gene expression and improve our understanding of activity-pattern-dependent synaptic plasticity. In genome-scale experiments comparing brief and sustained activity patterns, we reveal that activity-duration history can be inferred from gene expression profiles. Brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the activity-regulated gene program that corresponds to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. Induction of these first-wave genes is mechanistically distinct from that of the later waves because it requires {MAPK}/{ERK} signaling but does not require de novo translation. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of gene induction also enable different gene sets to be induced by different activity durations.},

Since these remarkable functions of the neocortex cannot be explored in simple model preparations or in anesthetised animals, the neural basis of behaviour must be explored in awake behaving subjects. Because neocortical function is highly distributed across many rapidly interacting regions, it is essential to measure spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical activity in real-time.

	shorttitle = {{NoRMCorre}},
	abstract = {Background
Motion correction is a challenging pre-processing problem that arises early in the analysis pipeline of calcium imaging data sequences. The motion artifacts in two-photon microscopy recordings can be non-rigid, arising from the finite time of raster scanning and non-uniform deformations of the brain medium.
New method
We introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid Motion Correction ({NoRMCorre}) based on template matching. {NoRMCorre} operates by splitting the field of view ({FOV}) into overlapping spatial patches along all directions. The patches are registered at a sub-pixel resolution for rigid translation against a regularly updated template. The estimated alignments are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid artifacts in a piecewise-rigid manner.
Existing methods
Existing approaches either do not scale well in terms of computational performance or are targeted to non-rigid artifacts arising just from the finite speed of raster scanning, and thus cannot correct for non-rigid motion observable in datasets from a large {FOV}.
Results
{NoRMCorre} can be run in an online mode resulting in comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration of streaming data. We evaluate its performance with simple yet intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid registration methods on simulated data and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is also made available.
Conclusions
The proposed method and accompanying code can be useful for solving large scale image registration problems in calcium imaging, especially in the presence of non-rigid deformations.},

	abstract = {The application of 2-photon laser scanning microscopy ({TPLSM}) techniques to measure the dynamics of cellular calcium signals in populations of neurons is an extremely powerful technique for characterizing neural activity within the central nervous system. The use of {TPLSM} on awake and behaving subjects promises new insights into how neural circuit elements cooperatively interact to form sensory perceptions and generate behavior. A major challenge in imaging such preparations is unavoidable animal and tissue movement, which leads to shifts in the imaging location (jitter). The presence of image motion can lead to artifacts, especially since quantification of {TPLSM} images involves analysis of fluctuations in fluorescence intensities for each neuron, determined from small regions of interest ({ROIs}). Here, we validate a new motion correction approach to compensate for motion of {TPLSM} images in the superficial layers of auditory cortex of awake mice. We use a nominally uniform fluorescent signal as a secondary signal to complement the dynamic signals from genetically encoded calcium indicators. We tested motion correction for single plane time lapse imaging as well as multiplane (i.e., volume) time lapse imaging of cortical tissue. Our procedure of motion correction relies on locating the brightest neurons and tracking their positions over time using established techniques of particle finding and tracking. We show that our tracking based approach provides subpixel resolution without compromising speed. Unlike most established methods, our algorithm also captures deformations of the field of view and thus can compensate e.g., for rotations. Object tracking based motion correction thus offers an alternative approach for motion correction, one that is well suited for real time spike inference analysis and feedback control, and for correcting for tissue distortions.},

	abstract = {Two-photon imaging of bulk-loaded calcium dyes can record action potentials ({APs}) simultaneously from dozens of spatially resolved neurons in vivo. Extending this technique to awake animals, however, has remained technically challenging due to artifacts caused by brain motion. Since in two-photon excitation microscopes image pixels are captured sequentially by scanning a focused pulsed laser across small areas of interest within the brain, fast displacements of the imaged area can distort the image nonuniformly. If left uncorrected, brain motion in awake animals will cause artifactual fluorescence changes, masking the small functional fluorescence increases associated with {AP} discharge. We therefore present a procedure for detection and correction of both fast and slow displacements in two-photon imaging of awake animals. Our algorithm, based on the Lucas–Kanade framework, operates directly on the motion-distorted imaging data, requiring neither external signals such as heartbeat nor a distortion-free template image. Motion correction accuracy was tested in silico over a wide range of simplified and realistic displacement trajectories and for multiple levels of fluorescence noise. Accuracy was confirmed in vivo by comparing solutions obtained from red and green fluorophores imaged simultaneously. Finally, the accuracy of {AP} detection from motion-displaced bulk-loaded calcium imaging is evaluated with and without motion correction, and we conclude that accurate motion correction as achieved by this procedure is both necessary and sufficient for single {AP} detection in awake animals.},

We also explore available evidence on the possible involvement of the vasculature in other phenomena such as the diversification of {NSCs} during evolution and we provide original data on the senescence of {NSCs} in the subependymal zone stem cell niche.

	abstract = {Local Ca2+ Releases ({LCRs}) are crucial events involved in cardiac pacemaker cell function. However, specific algorithms for automatic {LCR} detection and analysis have not been developed in live, spontaneously beating pacemaker cells. In the present study we measured {LCRs} using a high-speed 2D-camera in spontaneously contracting sinoatrial ({SA}) node cells isolated from rabbit and guinea pig and developed a new algorithm capable of detecting and analyzing the {LCRs} spatially in two-dimensions, and in time. Our algorithm tracks points along the midline of the contracting cell. It uses these points as a coordinate system for affine transform, producing a transformed image series where the cell does not contract. Action potential-induced Ca2+ transients and {LCRs} were thereafter isolated from recording noise by applying a series of spatial filters. The {LCR} birth and death events were detected by a differential (frame-to-frame) sensitivity algorithm applied to each pixel (cell location). An {LCR} was detected when its signal changes sufficiently quickly within a sufficiently large area. The {LCR} is considered to have died when its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising whole cell Ca2+ transient. Ultimately, our algorithm provides major {LCR} parameters such as period, signal mass, duration, and propagation path area. As the {LCRs} propagate within live cells, the algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the importance of locally propagating Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release for the fate of {LCRs} and for generating a powerful ensemble Ca2+ signal. Thus, our new computer algorithms eliminate motion artifacts and detect 2D local spatiotemporal events from recording noise and global signals. While the algorithms were developed to detect {LCRs} in sinoatrial nodal cells, they have the potential to be used in other applications in biophysics and cell physiology, for example, to detect Ca2+ wavelets (abortive waves), sparks and embers in muscle cells and Ca2+ puffs and syntillas in neurons.},

	abstract = {In vivo calcium imaging has become a method of choice to image neuronal population activity throughout the nervous system. These experiments generate large sequences of images. Their analysis is computationally intensive and typically involves motion correction, image segmentation into regions of interest ({ROIs}), and extraction of fluorescence traces from each {ROI}. Out of focus fluorescence from surrounding neuropil and other cells can strongly contaminate the signal assigned to a given {ROI}. In this study, we introduce the {FISSA} toolbox (Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis) for neuropil decontamination. Given pre-defined {ROIs}, the {FISSA} toolbox automatically extracts the surrounding local neuropil and performs blind-source separation with non-negative matrix factorization. Using both simulated and in vivo data, we show that this toolbox performs similarly or better than existing published methods. {FISSA} requires only little {RAM}, and allows for fast processing of large datasets even on a standard laptop. The {FISSA} toolbox is available in Python, with an option for {MATLAB} format outputs, and can easily be integrated into existing workflows. It is available from Github and the standard Python repositories.},

	abstract = {In vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging is a powerful tool for recording neuronal activities during perceptual tasks and has been increasingly applied to behaving animals for acute or chronic experiments. However, the auditory cortex is not easily accessible to imaging because of the abundant temporal muscles, arteries around the ears and their lateral locations. Here, we report a protocol for two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the auditory cortex of head-fixed behaving mice. By using a custom-made head fixation apparatus and a head-rotated fixation procedure, we achieved two-photon imaging and in combination with targeted cell-attached recordings of auditory cortical neurons in behaving mice. Using synthetic Ca2+ indicators, we recorded the Ca2+ transients at multiple scales, including neuronal populations, single neurons, dendrites and single spines, in auditory cortex during behavior. Furthermore, using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators ({GECIs}), we monitored the neuronal dynamics over days throughout the process of associative learning. Therefore, we achieved two-photon functional imaging at multiple scales in auditory cortex of behaving mice, which extends the tool box for investigating the neural basis of audition-related behaviors.},
